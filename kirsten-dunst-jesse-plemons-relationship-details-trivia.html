Three years after their relationship started, they have achieved many things: they got engaged, had a baby, and both are very supportive when it comes to their careers. Here is everything we know about them.</p><h2 id=they-met-on-set-and-it-was-not-love-at-first-sight><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Met On Set And It Was Not Love At First Sight</span></h2><p>Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons were cast to play a married couple in Fargo back in 2015. They started just as friends, but <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Plemons said that</a> they had a connection since the first minute: "I knew that she would be in my life for a long time."</p><p>In another interview, the actor said that he admired her work for a long time, and it was fantastic having the chance to work with her. As we know, they are not the first <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couple who met on set</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rumors-about-their-relation-started-one-year-later><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rumors About Their Relation Started One Year Later</span></h2><p>When Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons met, she was in a relationship with Garrett Hedlund. They broke up in 2016, and most people felt surprised. Two months after their split, Dunst and Plemons were spotted kissing, and people started to speculate if it was something serious. It didn't take long until the press and fans had their answer.</p><p>After the photos were published, the couple didn't try to hide their relationship. They went everywhere together, but they didn't talk about it during interviews.</p><h2 id=they-admire-each-other><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Admire Each Other</span></h2><p>Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons give a hard time to the press when they ask personal questions. Since they became a couple, they provide little information about their relationship, but it is obvious how they admire each other as professionals and human beings. Last year, Plemons said that he was nervous about meeting Dunst because she was <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of his favorite actresses</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I looked into her eyes and saw the beautiful, sweet, unguarded, welcoming, human being that she is. It was truly in an instant," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said.</a>&nbsp;The actress seems to be just as much in love as he is. "You are my everything, and I never thought I would have a partner that understands me the way that you do," she said.</p><h2 id=they-got-engaged-one-year-later><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Got Engaged One Year Later</span></h2><p>Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons were a match made on heaven, and they seem to be always happy around each other.

The actress said that she likes to keep things private, but shared some details about their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Lovato And Max Ehrich & 9 More Celeb Couples Who Got Engaged Quickly</a></span></p><p>The actress said they became really good friends firsts, and it was something that paved the way for their romance. Dunst said he proposed when she was sick, and she saw it as a good sign. "In sickness and in health," she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kirsten-dunst-announced-her-pregnancy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kirsten Dunst Announced Her Pregnancy</span></h2><p>In 2014, Kirsten Dunst <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave an interview</a> saying that she was on "baby mode" because many of her friends were pregnant and motherhood was something she wished for the near future. It seems that everything happens at the right time, and the actress got pregnant in 2017.</p><p>The rumors about her pregnancy started in December, and the actress confirmed it in January with a fashionable photoshoot of her baby bump. She looks stunning!</p><h2 id=the-couple-welcomes-a-baby-boy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Couple Welcomes A Baby Boy</span></h2><p>Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons welcomed their first baby boy, Ennis Howard, in May 2018. The couple remained private during the pregnancy, but they shared the information with the fans when Ennis was born. Unsurprisingly, the low-profile couple didn't share a picture of their baby or gave more details.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Tom Brady & Gisele Bündchen: 10 Things To Know About Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>It would take a long time until the fans finally saw a picture of Ennis. But one thing fans were sure: the couple was looking happier than ever.</p><h2 id=they-want-an-intimate-wedding><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Want An Intimate Wedding</span></h2><p>Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons were not in a rush to walk down the aisle, but the actress said they would do that eventually. "It's a priority, but you know how life is. You've got other little things. So it has to be a good time when we can all have fun," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunst told US Weekly</a>.</p><p>The actress said that the coupe was planning an intimate wedding, with few friends and family. The initial idea was to have a ceremony at home or somewhere that brought this feeling of intimacy.</p><h2 id=the-first-picture-of-their-son><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The First Picture Of Their Son</span></h2><p>In 2019, Kirsten Dunst finally got her star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but someone stole her spotlight during the ceremony. It was the first time the public saw the whole family together, and everyone was charmed by Ennis. The boy is a perfect combination of both stars, and he looks adorable!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Female Celebs Who Married Younger Men (& Their Age Gap)</a></span></p><p>During the event, Jesse Plemons made a speech and said that Dunst was a brilliant artist. "Seeing the kind of mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, and cohort you are is why I and all of your friends and everyone else are here today and why we all love you," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Plemons added.</a> "It's for the incredibly generous and amazing person that you are."</p><h2 id=husband-and-wife><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Husband And Wife?</span></h2><p>During the Hollywood Walk of Fame event, Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons referred to each other as husband and wife multiple times. Of course, everyone was curious and wanted to know if they tied the knot in a secret ceremony.</p><p>It is something that would make sense since they are both discrete when it comes to their relationship. Kirsten Dunst explained in an interview that they were not married. "Fiancé, we're not married yet," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-spending-time-in-new-zealand><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Are Spending Time In New Zealand</span></h2><p>In 2020, the couple decided to rent a home near Auckland in New Zealand. They had to spend time there due to Dunst's latest film, The Power of the Dog, but they are having the best time there. Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons wanted to give their son the chance to live near nature and "have some grass to run around on," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><p>"There are horses around here. And we have two old cats living with us, one of whom, Sid, brings us a mouse every night. ... Yesterday, we let [Ennis] be naked all day, and he'd pee outside in the grass. He thought it was so funny," she added.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Hollywood Couples Got Engaged, But Never Got Married</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqqjqbKvecOupaysXZ%2BytL%2FEZqelnZ2ku7R50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMramirpmWfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cat-osterman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-100756-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cat Osterman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
