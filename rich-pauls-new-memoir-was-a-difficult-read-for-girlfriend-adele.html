He remained close to his father, who had another family, by working alongside him at a corner shop.</p><p>“I had a great example of who a man should be and what a man should do,” Paul told the outlet. “I had a front row seat to what work ethic was like, what perseverance was like. I watched my dad play air traffic controller in a community that was a war mixed with a tornado, but also a picnic at times. He was my hero in that regard.”</p><p>Paul’s life was later changed after sparking a friendship with a teenage <a href=#><strong>LeBron James</strong></a> as he went on to become the NBA star’s longtime agent.</p><p>Like Paul, Adele, 35, also had a <a href=#>difficult relationship</a> with one of her parents. Her father, Mark Evans, left her and her mother, <strong>Penny Adkins</strong>, at a young age and resurfaced once she found success in the music industry. Adele later cut ties with him following <a href=#>a falling out in 2012</a>.</p><p>Two years later, Evans — who died at the age of 57 in May 2021 —revealed that <a href=#>he and Adele reconciled in 2013</a> after he asked for her forgiveness while battling bowel cancer. “It was a misunderstanding,” he told The Sun at the time. “We’ve patched things up, everything’s fine, but I don’t want to make further comment.”</p><p>In October 2021, Adele said she and Evans “got our peace before he died,” telling <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a>, “When he passed, I had this sort of physical reaction. That fear left my body. My mom was incredible when my dad was at the final stages. She was there and helping.”</p><p>That same month, she told <a href=# rel=noopener>British Vogue</a> that she got to play her 2021 album, <a href=#>30</a>, for Evans before his death. “I found the peace to forgive him,” she added. “He was ready to go and he lasted a long time with it. So thank you.”</p><p>Following her father’s death, Adele <a href=#>sparked dating rumors with Paul</a> after they attended a July 2021 NBA Finals match together. The couple later sparked engagement rumors after Adele <a href=#>sported a diamond ring</a> at the 2022 Brit Awards. “If I was [engaged], would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn’t?” she told <strong>Graham Norton</strong> in <a href=#>February 2022</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last month, Adele raised eyebrows after <a href=#>referring to Paul as her “husband”</a> and <a href=#>herself as a “wife”</a> during performances of her <a href=#>Las Vegas residency</a>. “They aren’t married,” a source exclusively confirmed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> on Thursday, October 5, “but they do call each other husband and wife and have been for a while now.”</p><p>The insider added: “Marriage is really just a ceremony at this point. They [already] live and act as husband and wife.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroZOderGt1KWqZqaVrHquscyooKtlp5bAbq2MnaCfnpmYwq3AjKucmpxdm7yzecaiqaWeop6yr7CMmpuepJVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philip-defranco-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Philip DeFranco Net Worth How Much is DeFranco Worth?</span></a>
