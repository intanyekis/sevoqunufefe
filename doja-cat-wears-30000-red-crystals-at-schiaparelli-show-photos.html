The shimmering jewels adorned every inch of Doja’s body including her eyelids, lips, chest and arms. The head-turning beat was brought to life by <a href=#><strong>Pat McGrath</strong></a>, who used over 30,000 gems via hand-application. “It was an honor to collaborate with the incredibly gifted @DojaCat and @DanielRoseberry on ‘Doja’s Inferno’ look for @Schiaparelli’s FW23 Haute Couture collection,” the beauty guru, 57, wrote via Instagram on Monday.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>McGrath explained the makeup took “four hours and 58 minutes” to create and commended the “Rules” singer’s “patience and commitment.” She added: “The final product was a magical, mesmerizing masterpiece and a tribute to Doja Cat’s hard work and dedication.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The makeup perfectly complemented Doja’s rosy strapless dress that featured a cinching bodice and a textured skirt made of protruding beads. The Grammy winner accessorized with a fiery stole and dangling earrings. On her feet, the hitmaker wore coral-colored knee-high boots. The footwear also commanded attention as the vamp was made to resemble an open-toe design.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Doja is no rookie when it comes to debuting daring glam.

The “Streets” songstress also sported bold red lipstick and had her arms coated in black ink. As for her outfit, Doja donned a sexy black cutout dress. Days later, the rap star donned an airbrushed gold look to attend the A.W.A.K.E. presentation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When trolls slammed her glam as “ugly,” Doja was quick to clap back. “I wasn’t trying to look sexy or attractive,” she wrote via Twitter at the time. “All of my makeup has a story and there are absolutely zero rules and if there were, you wouldn’t be the one making them.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Doja has been known to push beauty boundaries with her hair too. In August 2022, she <a href=#>unveiled a buzz cut and shaved brows</a> while chatting with fans on Instagram Live.&nbsp;“I was never supposed to have hair,” the “Woman” singer told her followers. “I don’t like having hair. I never liked having hair. I cannot tell you one time since the beginning of my life that I’ve ever been like, ‘This is cool.’ I just do not like to have hair.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to get all the details on Doja’s red glam at the Schiaparelli show:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvDqKGaZZOWwW7DxJqprGVjZX1xfIyrnJ1lk6fGtMDApapmmaRiwKS0yJqnmqqVobmqedKhprBloJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlie-sheen-will-receive-full-custody-if-brooke-mueller-fails-drug-test.html><span>←</span><span>Charlie Sheen Will Receive Full Custody If Brooke Mueller Fails Drug Test</span></a>
