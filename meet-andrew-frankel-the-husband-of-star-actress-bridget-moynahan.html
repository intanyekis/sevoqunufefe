But I got so much out of that. It’s golden and it’s tough and it was f***ed up. But now I have a child, and it’s the best thing in the world.”</p><p>“Tom and I made a decision to raise a child together and we both found partners that not only supported us in raising that child but also loved our child as if he was their own, I don’t think you can ask for more than that. My son is surrounded by love and grandparents that go on forever, and it’s all good,” She told Moynahan told&nbsp;People in 2019.</p><p>However, they both share custody of the child who is now 14 years old.
