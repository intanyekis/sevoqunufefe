That said, his show has been a place to expose the dysfunctions in other people's lives and criticize them for their actions. If you decided to make an appearance, there's a good chance you could be ripped apart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Springer's own life is much more private. But we do know that he was married to Micki Velton from 1973 to 1994. Where is Velton now, and has she completely disappeared from the limelight? Well, she's never really been one to enjoy public attention, but it's true that she has recently she has come back onto everyone's radar…</p><h2 id=how-did-jerry-springer-die>How Did Jerry Springer Die?</h2><p>Jerry Springer and Micki Velton were married from 1973 to 1994. During their time together, they also had one daughter, Katie Springer. Despite being together for over two decades, their relationship has recently come back into the limelight after it was announced that Jerry passed away on April 27, 2023.</p><p>He passed away at his home in Chicago, Sky News reports. He had been previously <a href=#>diagnosed with pancreatic cancer</a> and was 79.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Jerry Springer Said In Response To Rumors Guests On His Show Were Paid Actors</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Jerry's ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word," family friend Jene Galvin said in a statement, Sky News reports.</p><p>"He's irreplaceable, and his loss hurts immensely, but memories of his intellect, heart and humor will live on."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jerry-springer.jpg><p>Many people felt the loss of Jerry Springer, including Steve Wilkos, who is reported to have had the chance to share <a href=#>one last emotional moment with him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite not being together when Jerry passed, the news renewed interest in his relationship with Velton because he was only married once. This could also be because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer failed to connect with people</a>, at least romantically, as he was very popular.</p><p>"People know me straight away as the TV guy, so we are not starting off on a level footing. They already know a bunch of stuff about me, whereas I don't know them at all," he said, according to The Mirror.</p><p>"When you get to the mutual interests, it's all about, 'What's the show like? Is it real?' and invariably, they are going to go home afterward and tell all their friends, 'I met Jerry Springer.' So you will never find someone who will just say, 'Hey, I just met this really nice guy, you should meet him.'"</p><h2 id=inside-jerry-springer-39-s-relationship-with-wife-micki-velton>Inside Jerry Springer's Relationship With Wife Micki Velton</h2><p>Jerry Springer and Micki Velton met after being set up on a blind date in 1969, The Sun reports. They would marry in 1973 and welcome their daughter, Katie, three years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/micki-velton-s-life-after-divorcing-jerry-springer-has-been-downright-mysterious-here-s-what-we-know.jpg><p>Their marriage lasted two decades, but it was not without its issues. This is because, in 1973, Springer made headlines for visiting a brothel, The Mirror reports. The publication claims that he confessed to paying workers twice but that Velton forgave him for his indiscretions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jerry Springer Was Clearly Uncomfortable With David Letterman's Question And Purposely Decided To Change The Subject During Their Interview</a></span></p><p>They would remain together, so it is highly unlikely that these actions had any lasting impact on Springer's marriage. But as for what went wrong, and what led to their divorce? There has been no confirmation of this, and it's possible that their relationship ran its course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-micki-velton>What Happened To Micki Velton?</h2><p>Jerry Springer was comfortable in front of the cameras and has given several interviews throughout his life (he had also <a href=#>amassed an impressive net worth</a>). However, his ex-wife was not one for fame. Instead, she preferred to stay out of the limelight, even when they were married.</p><p>The same can be said for her life following the divorce, and it is near impossible to find out what Micki Velton has been up to because she has removed herself from the public eye. She also does not appear to have social media (at least not publicly or in her name), which makes her even more mysterious. And don't expect to see any photos of her taken by the paparazzi anytime, either!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jerry-springer-was-clearly-uncomfortable-with-david-letterman-s-question-and-purposely-decided-to-change-the-subject-during-their-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But they appear to have remained in touch because Closer Weekly reports that the former couple were photographed together outside The Ritz hotel in New York City. This was in 2011 (many years after they got divorced).</p><p>The mystery extends to Jerry Springer, who was also incredibly private about his personal life. But we know he was a grandfather, a role he appeared to enjoy. His only child, Katie, married Adam Yenkin, and they had a child, Richard. Springer spoke about his grandson in an interview with New York Post (via Yahoo) when his grandson was three.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Jerry Springer Before He Became The King Of Daytime Television?</a></span></p><p>"He'll be three years old next month, and he still doesn't have a job," Springer joked. "He's wonderful. He's gorgeous, a lovely kid, and tall. Now that's a good-looking kid."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jerry-springer-marry-anyone-other-than-micki-velton>Did Jerry Springer Marry Anyone Other Than Micki Velton?</h2><p>We previously mentioned that Micki Velton was Jerry Springer's only wife, but he did speak about a wife in a later interview. In 2021, he appeared on the HollywoodLife podcast and discussed looking for nursing homes. In this interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he mentioned his "wife</a>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/what-jerry-springer-said-in-response-to-rumors-guests-on-his-show-were-paid-actors.jpg><p>"I'm telling you, wait till I'm 96, I've got an idea, I'm going to hit the nursing homes, and that's going to be my tour. No comedian does a tour of nursing homes," he said at the time.</p><p>"And I'm thinking if I did that, first of all, I wouldn't have any problem then with keep telling the same old jokes. Because no one in the home's going to remember you. That's my new, in fact, my wife and I, we talk about it. And when we're looking for a home, it's got to be one that has a social program."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Springer was not asked to elaborate on who his wife was, so it is impossible to know if he still refers to Micki Velton as his wife or if he was in another relationship and perhaps misspoke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brnInKKiZaaaubW7zaxkmp6kmr9utsSrqbJlo6W%2FqrrGnqlmnJmrvLOvxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-marcille-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Marcille Net Worth How Much is Marcille Worth?</span></a>
