Fans were able to explore the depths of his thoughts and overall belief system in relation to these universally critical matters. Gates was openly conversational, and didn't hesitate to weigh in on these topics, giving fans more insight about not just the world events as they are unfolding, but how he, and the rest of the world, can take steps towards building a better future. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Geekwire </a>reports that the open forum proved to be a fabulous opportunity to learn more about his perspective and gain knowledge in key areas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4 Unique Tech In Bill Gates' $154 Million Mansion Fit For An Innovator</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Gates</a> had previously predicted this pandemic would occur, and is now reminding his fans that there is more danger in store if we don't take swift action, and adapt to new lifestyle changes in advance.

He advises that eating synthetic meat and forcing a change in the market would be a monumental step forward. This was one of his top pieces of advice to ensure that our current population remains on top of climate change concerns and actively seeks a shift. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News 18</a> quoted him as saying; "I do think all rich countries should move to 100% synthetic beef... you can get used to the taste difference, and the claim is they’re going to make it taste even better over time. Eventually, that green premium is modest enough that you can sort of change the people or use regulation to totally shift the demand.” This is one of the methods he suggests we foster to reduce methane emissions, and the world is listening.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the topic of COVID-19, he revealed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Bill Gates Foundation is donating millions</a> and putting forth great efforts in ensuring that therapeutics and vaccines are being produced and prioritized properly, to ensure that all countries receive the care they need to overcome this pandemic.</p><p>He is also focused on increasing education efforts and putting the focus on manufacturing to ensure that all aspects of the vaccine, respirators, and other required resources are readily available.</p><p>He cautions that he predicts we will see other pandemics in our lifetime, and mastering the art of managing this one will help towards building greater future resiliancy.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Expensive Things Owned By Bill Gates</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Crunch</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News 18</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GeekWire</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvqrjLZp6arJWoerWty6SqZqupo8GpsdOimmallZbBbq%2FOr6CdZZOhtq6t055knKCRo7SmedGem52hpGKurq2O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ava-eliot-jackman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-645870-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ava Eliot Jackman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
