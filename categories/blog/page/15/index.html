Come On Eileen
Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
He moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers used to sing along who’d blame them
You’re grown, so grown, now I must say more than ever
Come on Eileen
Toora loora toora loo rye aye
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on Eileen, oh I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Dickinson Finale Revealed It Was Secretly A Deeply Personal Passion Project For The Creator</h2><time>Aug 21, 2024</time>
