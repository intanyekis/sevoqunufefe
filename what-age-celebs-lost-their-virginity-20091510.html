In 2010, Joe Jonas opened up about losing his virginity at age 20 to Ashley Greene.
“I didn’t have any condoms, so I went to our drummer Jack’s room — who was my roommate at the time — and I demolished his room looking for them,” he said in a Reddit AMA at the time."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While some celebrities keep their sexual experiences close to their chests, others have no problem kissing and telling about their first times.</p><p>In 2010, <a href=#><strong>Joe Jonas</strong></a> opened up about losing his virginity at age 20 to <a href=#><strong>Ashley Greene</strong></a>.</p><p>“I didn’t have any condoms, so I went to our drummer Jack’s room — who was my roommate at the time — and I demolished his room looking for them,” he <a href=#>said in a Reddit AMA</a> at the time. “[I] found them underneath his underwear drawer. When he came home, he thought somebody broke into his room because his whole room was demolished.”</p><p>The reveal was quite shocking to fans as the Jonas Brothers wore purity rings for years, vowing not to have premarital sex. In 2016, he stated that he didn’t regret <a href=#>sharing that personal experience</a> with the world.</p><p>“Life’s too short, you know?” the DNCE singer told Entertainment Tonight at the time. “I mean ultimately, I think of myself as an honest guy. There are just those moments in life where you have to be true to yourself and true to the world. … I’m not out to hurt anybody, but I think, ultimately, I’m just telling my stories and what I can say from my heart.”</p><p>Another former Disney Channel star that has been open about her early sexual experiences is <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>.</p><p>“I didn’t go<a href=#> all the way with a dude until I was 16,</a> but I ended up marrying the guy,” the singer said on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in August 2020, implying that she lost her virginity to <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>, whom she was married to from 2018 to 2020. “I lied and said that he wasn’t the first so I didn’t seem like a loser. He said, ‘Oh, who have you had sex with?’ And I couldn’t think of anyone, so I just made somebody up that I knew but we had never actually had sex before.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Other celebs <a href=#>waited until much later</a> in life. <a href=#><strong>Adriana Lima</strong></a> didn’t have sex until marrying <strong>Marko Jarić</strong> in 2009. “Sex is just for after marriage,” she told <a href=#>GQ</a> magazine in 2006. “I don’t care [what men think about me waiting]. They have to respect that this is my choice. If there’s no respect, that means they don’t want me.”</p><p>From the extremely awkward to the really romantic encounters, see what the stars had to say about their first times:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKmt02aYoJ1dmLKtscGsZKWno6l6tbTEoqlmrpmntKq6yK2wZmpgZYZygZBpZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quincy-jones-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Quincy Jones Net Worth</span></a>
