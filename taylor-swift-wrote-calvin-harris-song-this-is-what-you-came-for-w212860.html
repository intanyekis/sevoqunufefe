Though the track is currently credited to Sjoberg on Wikipedia, eagle-eyed fans noticed that the page used to feature Swift as the writer. Many speculated — correctly, it turns out — that she’d used a pen name.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>However, Harris previously shot down any suggestion of a collaboration with his now-ex-girlfriend in April, when they were still dating. The day of the song’s release, he sat down with </span><b>Ryan Seacrest</b><span> for an interview, during which the former </span><i>American Idol</i><span> host asked if he planned to work with Swift.</span></p><p><span>“You know, we haven’t really spoken about it,” Harris said at the time. “I can’t see it happening.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/546040450_tom-hiddleston-taylor-swift-vertical-zoom-a31073e0-55e1-4fed-aabc-8a2610f641f7.jpg><p><span>The couple split just a little over a month later. Two weeks after the breakup, Swift started up a romance with </span><b><a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a></b><span>, with whom she’d had a memorable encounter at the 2016 Met Gala in May.</span></p><p><span>In the weeks since, the pop star and the </span><i>Thor</i><span> actor have paraded their new love all over the globe, from Rhode Island to Nashville to England to Australia. Things have gotten very serious, very quickly — a source says in the new issue of <i>Us Weekly</i> that the Brit <a href=#>is “planning to propose” soon</a>.</span></p><p><span>Check out Ian Drew and Jamie Blynn dishing on this story during <i></i><a href=#><i>Us Weekly’s </i>Facebook Live News Update</a> today at 1:30pm ET.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWnp7y1sYycmKWumaN6qa3Rq6CsZaOku6h506GgrGWZqHq4tMCtZLKnpWKwornEZp2oql2sf3J%2Bl29naA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quincy-jones-daughter-dated-tupac.html><span>←</span><span>Quincy Jones Daughter Dated Tupac</span></a>
