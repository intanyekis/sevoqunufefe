She was born on April 15, 2005, in Austin, Texas. She grew up with her parents and siblings in Austin, Texas where she also attended an undisclosed high school. Gracie is currently a high school student.</p><p>Her parents are Mark William Calaway (popularly known as The Undertaker) and Sara Calaway. She has three siblings whose names are Chasey Calaway, Gunner Vincent Calaway, and Kaia Faith.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Gracie Calaway’s Mother?</strong></h2><p>Gracie Calaway’s mother is Sara Calaway (born Sara Chirie Frank), an American professional wrestler and wrestling valet. Sara discovered her passion for wrestling while in high school and was fondly nicknamed The Strong One by her classmates who noticed her strength.</p><p>Despite her early exposure to wrestling, Sara only became a professional wrestler with her debut at the 2001 King of the Ring. Furthermore, an alleged stalker released several footages of her wrestling and this also contributed to her rise to fame. Sara also appeared as a valet for her ex-husband The Undertaker in 2001 and the 2002 WWE.</p><h2><strong>What Happened To Gracie Calaway’s Parents?</strong></h2><p>Calaway’s parents are divorced. The celebrity couple who got married on 21 July 2000 seemingly had a loving marriage. During their time together, her mother Sara served as a valet to The Undertaker and also made public appearances with him at events. There are also videos showing the couple wrestling together and all of these made the news of their divorce shocking to their fans.</p><p>While they never disclosed the reason for their divorce, it was alleged that The Undertaker had cheated on his wife with WWE Diva Michelle McCool and this put a dent in their happy union. Dracie Calaway’s parents eventually settled for a divorce in 2007 after just seven years together. Barely three years later, The Undertaker went ahead to marry Michelle, giving credibility to the cheating rumors.</p><p>The divorce notwithstanding, Gracie’s parents have remained good friends and have jointly raised the two children they had together. The Undertaker had tattooed his ex-wife Sara’s name on his throat as a wedding gift to her and after their divorce, he re-inked it to make it look like a sketchy chain.</p><h3><strong>Her Father’s Career Affected Her Relationship with Him</strong></h3><p>Gracie Calaway has not always had a great relationship with her father. He does not post pictures of her on his social media handles and during a 2022 interview, the former WWE champion revealed that he had spent so much time advancing his career and this negatively affected the relationship he has with his older children as he was never around for their special moments.</p><p>While the Undertaker has reconciled with his son <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Gunner</a>, it is not confirmed if the relationship between him and his daughters has improved. The former WWE champion still does not upload pictures of Gracie and her sister and they, in turn, have never publicly spoken about him.</p><h2><strong>Meet Gracie Calaway’s Siblings</strong></h2><p>Gracie Callaway has three siblings, a biological sister named Chasey Calaway and two half-siblings Gunner Vincent Calaway, and Kaia Faith Calaway. Find out all about them below.</p><h3><b>Chasey Calaway was Born in 2002</b></h3><p>Chasey Calaway is Gracie Calaway’s only biological sibling and elder sister. She was born on November 21, 2002, in Austin, Texas. Like her sister, Chasey prefers to live her life away from the media glare and we could not confirm details of her current lifestyle. While she has an Instagram account @ChaseyCalaway, she has not made any recent uploads.</p><h3><b>Gunner Vincent Calaway was Born by Jodi Lynn Calaway</b></h3><p>Gunner Vincent Calaway is Gracie’s half-brother. He is the son of her father’s first wife Jodi Lynn Calaway but after she divorced The Undertaker, Jodi got full custody of her son and this made it difficult for Gracie and Gunner to build a relationship. Gunner currently works as a streamer, freelance artist, and illustrator.</p><h3><strong>Kaia Faith Calaway was Born by Michelle McCool</strong></h3><p>Kaia is The Undertaker’s first child with his third wife Michelle McCool. She was born in August 2012 and appears to be his favorite daughter. He revealed that she gave him a new perspective on parenting and made him more involved in his personal life as a husband and father. We could not confirm if Kaia has any existing relationship with Gracie and her other half-siblings.</p><h2><strong>What Does The Undertaker’s Daughter Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Gracie Calaway is still enrolled in college and as such, she has not chosen a career path yet. Considering that she was born to highly athletic parents, we are watching to see if she would opt for a career in sports, just like her former WWE father, or chart a path of her own like her brother Gunner did.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Gracie Calaway Dating Now?</strong></h3><p>Gracie Calaway has not revealed the details of anyone she is currently dating. We could also not confirm the identity of anyone she has previously been in a relationship with, but for a young girl of her age, she still has a lot of years ahead to build her love life with the right person.</p><h3><strong>Is Gracie Calaway Active on Social Media?</strong></h3><p>Gracie Calaway is active on social media. She has a Twitter account @CalawayGracie which was set up in April 2013. However, she does not update the account as her last post was made in May 2014. Gracie does not have any other active social media accounts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdnL%2Bir8ieZJyZnJbEosWMnq2eqqmptaq6xmaYm6elqXq1tMRmrKeclafBorfEq6pmnJGqtKnAxKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-may-death-cause-stroke-fall-photo-shoot.html><span>←</span><span>Stroke Caused By Nasty Fall At Photo Shoot 1 Week Earlier Hollywood Life</span></a>
