The lawsuit filed by their former nanny wages on, and the parents-of-two could be on the hook for millions in damages, or at least legal fees, given how long the case has been waging on.</p><p>Earlier this month, Ericka Genaro, who was formerly employed as an au pair by the couple, lodged an appeal against the court's previous ruling to transfer the case to mediation. Genaro submitted her appeal to the 2nd District Court of Appeal in California on October 3, arguing it was an error to approve Wilde and Sudeikis' request to shift the case from a traditional courtroom setting with a jury to arbitration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tr-dark.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Olivia Wilde Sells LA Home She Once Shared With Jason Sudeikis Amid Child Support War</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Olivia Wilde made a profit on the home she once resided in with Jason Sudeikis and their kids, though she won it following their break-up.</span><p>“We respectfully disagree with the judge’s decision to move this case into private arbitration and are seeking all avenues to have the ruling reversed and allow us to try this case before a jury of their peers,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the nanny’s attorney, Ron Zambrano, said to Us Weekly</a>. “We believe the judge did not apply the actual facts presented to applicable law which should have led to a finding that the agreement was unenforceable.”</p><p>“The evidence is insurmountable to support our claims, including text messages and testimony that she was driven to quit, then was summarily fired anyway,” the attorney continued. “Ms. Wilde and Mr. Sudeikis merely want this case moved into arbitration to silence Ms. Genaro. We believe they should not be given special treatment merely because they are celebrities and should have to face their accuser in court.”</p><p>In February, Genaro filed a lawsuit against the actors, alleging wrongful termination. She had served as the nanny since 2019 to their son and daughter before her alleged dismissal, which she attributed to anxiety and depression resulting from her employment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following Jason and Olivia’s break-up in 2020, Genaro said she became an emotional support for the Ted Lasso actor, who she claims even asked her to have late-night discussions about their break-up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jason-sudeikis-olivia-wilde.jpg> Jason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde on the red carpet<p>Genaro said she eventually confided in Olivia about her exchanges with Jason, and claims she was let go shortly afterwards.</p><p>Jason and Olivia have denied Genaro’s claims and have expressed their intent to get her lawsuit dismissed. It’s unclear how much the former nanny is hoping to win in damages, but it could likely be a seven-figure settlement, given that she’s citing emotional distress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, given that the case has been going on for nearly a year, the legal bills are likely beginning to mount. Even if Jason and Olivia aren’t found responsible for wrongful termination, they may still have a lot of bills to pay just to get the lawsuit dismissed.</p><p>It was recently determined that Jason needs to pay his ex-partner over $27,000 in monthly child support. But with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason’s net worth of $20 million</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia’s reported fortune of $10 million</a>, it’s clear these two can afford to battle it out in court. Genaro’s lawsuit remains ongoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmo5mjpLtuv9SdnKKjmah6sLjIr6CaZaeeuaWxjKGsoJ1dobKorctmmaKknKh6r63Np7BmqpWmwqa%2F06xko62irnq1vsiao2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./imad-bichri-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-677926-html.html><span>←</span><span>Imad Bichri Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
