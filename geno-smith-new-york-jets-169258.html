Smith will reportedly earn $5 million through four years and is expected to compete with Mark Sanchez for a starting position at quarterback. Over the weekend, Smith confidently told reporters he has a “great shot” at winning the starting role an that he is already comfortable with the team’s play book. “I want to be the best,” Smith told the Charleston Gazette. “It’s going to take time and effort, and that’s what I’m willing to put in. Once I step on the field, it’s about business. I’m really appreciative to have made it to this level, but there’s a lot more for me out there and I’m going to try and strive for it.”</p><p>Smith made headlines several months agO after becoming the first NFL player to sign with Jay-Z’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_roc-nation-sports_3 data-tag=roc-nation-sports>Roc Nation sports</a> agency. Despite being snubbed at the draft and chosen in the second round, Smith’s dynamic offensive versatility may be what urged the rapper to take a chance on him. Jets head coach Rex Ryan has said numerous times that Smith certainly has the potential to be a starter for the organization, which missed out on the playoffs last season.</p><p>“Sometimes, you really can’t even notice them because when he’s on, the guy is absolutely terrific,” Ryan said, <a href=# rel=nofollow>according to ESPN</a>. “We knew it wasn’t going to be an easy process, but I have confidence that, when we get to Cortland [for training camp], I think you’re going to see the guy keep improving and improving.”</p><p>Photo Credit: Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5yyr7uMrKSirJhiu6bDjLKmq6Ndn7K1v4xqbXJqZW18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blue-sturgeon-super-moon-in-pisces.html><span>←</span><span>Blue supermoon in Pisces; doubling down release and revelry</span></a>
