The public wants to know more about the scandal.&nbsp;So, as per the curiosity of people, we are here to present you about that incident and also about the relationship of Jodi’ with her ex-lover including her other facts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Jodi_Arias_Dating_Anyone_Her_Past_Affairs></span>Is Jodi Arias Dating Anyone? Her Past Affairs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jodi Arias is possibly single at the moment and not in any dating relationship with anyone. She likes to keep her personal life mysterious. However, some people still want to know more about her private life after the murder of her ex-boyfriend&nbsp;<strong>Travis Alexander.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jodi-aries-300x227.png><p>Arias and Travis first met in September 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada in a Prepaid Legal Services convention. Furthermore, after only five months of dating, the pair ended their intimate relationship in June 2007.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Murder_of_Jodi_Arias%E2%80%99_Former_Boyfriend_Travis_Alexander_Facts_Related_to_the_Murder></span><strong>The Murder of Jodi Arias’ Former Boyfriend Travis Alexander; Facts Related to the Murder</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On June 9, 2008, Travis Alexander’s friends found his dead body in his master bathroom’s shower. Besides this, they found&nbsp;Alexander with a gunshot wound on his head, more than two dozen stab injuries, and a deep & wide slit throat.</p><p><strong>You May Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sophie Hunter’s Married Life</strong></a></p><p>Investigators later determined that the murder occurred five days before his dead body was found on June 4, 2008.&nbsp;After that, Jodi Arias became the focus of investigations.</p><p>After a thorough search, Jodi was found guilty of the murder of her former lover. As a result, she indicted on first-degree murder charges on July 9, 2008, and got arrested in California.</p><p class="title style-scope ytd-video-primary-info-renderer"><strong>YouTube: Investigation Discovery – Jodi Arias: An American Murder Mystery&nbsp;</strong></p><p>https://youtu.be/VHXAOcSAFig</p><p>Moreover, Arias initially refused any involvement in the killing, despite the discovery of her DNA mixed with Alexander’s blood at the crime scene. However, she changed her story later and again she claimed that she and her ex were attacked by two masked robbers.</p><p><strong>See Also: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Elfman’s Married Life with Husband</a></strong></p><p>After the following month, the alleged killer took the witness stand in her defense and finally claimed that she killed her ex-lover in an impassioned act of self-defense. Again,&nbsp; during the trial in response to a query from the jury, she stated:</p><p>”Lying isn’t typically something I just do, the lies I’ve told in this case can be tied directly back to either protecting Travis’s reputation or my involvement in his death because I was very ashamed.”</p><h3>The reason behind the Murder</h3><p>Although Jodi Arias ended her romance with Travis Alexander, they were in a sexual relationship until several months after their breakup. In addition to this, she totally started to obsess over him.</p><p>According to one of Alexander’s friends’ <strong>Sky Hughes,</strong></p><p>“She wouldn’t let him go. Whenever he would try to sever all ties, she would threaten to kill herself. He would tell her he didn’t want anything to do with her, and she would show up at his house.”</p><p>When Alexander began dating another girl,&nbsp;Arias slashed his tires and hacked into his Facebook accounts. Furthermore, the lady also stalked him on outings.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a>, Alexander told a friend not to be surprised if any of his friends found him dead one day.</p><p>Jodi had also visited Alexander at his Arizona home on June 4, 2008. There, they both&nbsp;took graphic sexual photos of one another and made a sex tape. However, Jodi claimed that was Alexander’s idea saying:</p><p>“He tied me up, the bed. It’s not my favorite but it’s not unbearable”</p><p>After all this, the police recovered deleted images of Arias and Alexander’s sexual poses. Alexander was las seen alive in the shower at around 5.29 pm on June 4.</p><h3>Penalties</h3><p>The first penalty for Jodi Arias began in October 2014,&nbsp;&nbsp;focusing on the psychological&nbsp;makeup. But again in March 2015, the second jury removed the option of the death penalty, leaving&nbsp;punishment terms.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Falahee Dating Affairs</a></strong></p><p>Although Jodi requested her conviction and sentencing, the process bogged down through transcript errors and omissions. And hence, the court finalized its decision in April 2017 and stated lifetime imprisonment of Jodi Arias.</p><p>On 2018, July 6, Jodi’ attorney, Margaret M. Green and Corey Engle appealed to have Arias’ conviction overturned. The response was due on January 4, 2019, however, the state hasn’t revealed anything about the issue.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jodi_Arias%E2%80%99_Net_Worth_and_Career></span>Jodi Arias’ Net Worth and Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Murderer Jodi Arias had an estimated net worth of over <strong>$10 million</strong>.
