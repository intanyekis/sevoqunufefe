He built a name for himself in the division with a dramatic knockout victory in his first fight in 2020, which also served as his debut.</p><p>With 25 of his 28 professional mixed&nbsp;martial arts victories&nbsp;coming by way of knockout, “The Czech Samurai” is undeniably a knockout specialist.</p><p>Fans were initially drawn to him due to his record in mixed martial arts competition (MMA) as well as his fighting style; however, this was not the only factor. Not only does Prochazka have an entrancing personality, but he is also well-known for the peculiar hairdo he sports.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="What Does Jiri Prochazka No Beard Look Like?">What Does Jiri Prochazka No Beard Look Like?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Jiri Prochazk Hairstyle And Face Structure Explained">Jiri Prochazk Hairstyle And Face Structure Explained</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-jiri-prochazka-no-beard-look-like></span>What Does Jiri Prochazka No Beard Look Like?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jiri Prochazka without a beard looks like a significantly different appearance compared to how he appears at the present time.</p><p>Beards are a form of facial hair that is considered a makeup for males. Their entire facial structure takes on a distinctively new appearance once the beard is shaved off. A person’s jawline can also be made to look stronger and more defined with a beard.</p><p>A strong jawline would actually make a fighter more likely to win because it would create more leverage for the punch against the rest of the skull, generating higher vibrations in the brain. This would make it more likely that the fighter would win. The beard has little use other than to obscure the appearance of the chin.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jiri-prochazk-hairstyle-and-face-structure-explained></span>Jiri Prochazk Hairstyle And Face Structure Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Prochazka sported a cutting-edge hairdo and appeared in the ring for his second fight. Even before the light heavyweight fighter entered the octagon, it almost immediately captured the attention of a large number of people.</p><p>During his pre-fight interview, the Czech boxer was asked about his hairdo, and he responded by referring to it as his “War Hair.” Before the bout, he gave the impression that he was taking particular pleasure in his new hairstyle.</p><p>In a later part of the same interview, the Czech Samurai described how his distinctive haircut was influenced by the mongkhon, a type of headgear that is traditionally worn by Muay Thai competitors.</p><p>Later on, he also won his second UFC battle by knocking out his opponent, Dominick Reyes, in a spectacular knockout in the second round of their fight. Additionally, Prochazka stated that he owed his victory to the way he wore his hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFusM6eqmaimae2brzRqJqhmaqgrm7DyK2fqK2kYq%2BmrdGdZKWnn6DAbrjIpJxmoJmoeqmtyKuqrbGcmnqiusNmnZqblWLAtb7UnKuuqpVisrm8y5qgp52UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nabhaan-rizwan.html><span>←</span><span>Nabhaan Rizwan</span></a>
