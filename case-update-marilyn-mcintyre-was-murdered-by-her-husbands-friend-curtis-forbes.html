She was brutally murdered in her own house.</p><p>Her spouse reported the incident to the police after seeing it happen. He witnessed his wife wounded with a knife when he got home from the office where he worked at a nearby paper mill in Columbus, Wisconsin.</p><p>He entered the child’s bedroom after seeing the horrifying and traumatic event to see how their three-month-old baby was doing. Their son Christopher was found to be secure.</p><p>When the police came, they discovered no signs of forced entry. Marilyn had permitted her assailant to enter the House, suggesting that it was somebody she knew.</p><p>She had been severely assaulted, suffocated, and had the knife stabbed into her chest before she passed away, according to the autopsy.</p><p>One of the prime suspects in the murder of Marilyn McIntyre is her husband, Lane McIntyre, who was undoubtedly innocent. Although he was not a party to the murder investigation, he was the subject of several indications.</p><p>He was at work the night Marilyn was slain, according to his chronology, although he regularly worked alone and was allowed to take breaks.</p><p>Just days before the death of his wife, he bought a life insurance policy on Marilyn, which raises questions. Even though Lane was an obvious suspect, there was no proof connecting him to the murder.</p><p>At the murder site, where they also found bloodstains and hair from an undetermined source, investigators collected fingerprint evidence.</p><h2><span id=Case_Update_Marilyn_McIntyre_Was_Murdered_by_Her_Husband8217s_Friend_Curtis_Forbes>Case Update: Marilyn McIntyre Was Murdered by Her Husband’s Friend Curtis Forbes</span></h2><p>The real murderer in the case of Marilyn McIntyre was Curtis Forbes, a friend of her husband’s, who wasn’t apprehended for many years. He was being looked into at the time the investigation started, but he escaped.</p><p>Police did not consider him at the time since there was no proof against him. However, a case update that came forth some 27 years later astonished many people.</p><p>Once again, with the case being reopened by the local Police, the Police felt confident in their ability to solve the mystery case using DNA evidence and cutting-edge research.</p><p>The final strategy of Forbes was to pretend to be dead. To do this, he would buy an inflatable raft, board a boat, and sink it in Lake Michigan, creating the appearance that Forbes had died in the crash and had been preparing to flee.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, Attleson acknowledged that she had seen blood on his clothing the morning of the murder when she was re-interviewed by police. They now had enough reliable evidence to arrest him.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
