They <a href=#>have been on the road since earlier this summer</a>, performing across the United States before traveling across the pond to Europe.</p><p class=p1>Hours before the announcement, Barker uploaded a pic via his Instagram Story of a “Prayer Room” with a sign that read, “All welcome.” He posted a second photo of the room’s chapel, complete with a stained glass window and a “Together We Pray” banner.</p><p class=p1>Barker’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, has also been quiet on social media amid the ordeal.

They’ve all been surrounding her night and day for anything she may need.
