You are in the prime of your life with four gorgeous children and living your best life!!”</p><p>The Skims founder also reposted some of her birthday messages to her Instagram Stories, including one from hairstylist <strong>Andrew Fitzsimons</strong>. “You’re a MF badass,” the hair guru wrote, attaching a photo of <a href=#>the reality star speaking at the White House</a>. “Could post a million shoots or covers but I’m just so proud of the work that you do for prison reform and the risks you take to change other people’s lives that people don’t even know about … HBD boss.”</p><p>The Selfish author has been busy in the weeks leading up to her big day, <a href=#>hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time</a> earlier this month and gearing up for <a href=#>the release of her family’s new Hulu series</a>.

We’re streaming so we get to have a much quicker turnaround than previously. We’re really excited.”</p><p>Kim has also been hammering out the details of her divorce from <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, with whom she shares North, 8, Saint, 5, Chicago, 3, and Psalm, 2.

According to court documents obtained by Us, $20 million of the sum was for the property itself, while $3 million was the price of items in the home including art and furniture.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Grammy winner designed much of the house himself, but <a href=#>a source told Us in March</a> that “there was never a question” that Kim would keep the home. “She has made her life there and it’s her kids’ main home,” the insider added.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more birthday messages from Kim’s family and friends:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1moKxlZGZ6rL7IrGSjnZ6jsrN5zKipnmWjmrulecGiqa2glJbGbsPIrJ%2Beq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./graham-wardle-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Graham Wardle Net Worth - Pulptastic</span></a>
