The actress had gained weight during pregnancy and she let herself go after her divorce. The Charlie's Angels star bounced back quickly with a weight loss for a new series. She had another weight gain again during quarantine and since then, is again in the process of losing weight. Drew Barrymore, besides having a supervised diet plan and workout schedule, also has revealed that she takes supplements and has taken the aid of a treatment called EmSculpt.</strong></p><p><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong> is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> who comes from one of the most prominent acting families, the Barrymores. She started acting when she was a child and first gained prominence when she did ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. Since then, she has been a part of several successful movies like Charlie's Angels, Never Been Kissed, Poison Ivy, Boys on the Side, Mad Love, Batman Forever, Scream, and Ever After.</p><p>The actress has several accolades to her name, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. She also has nominations for a British Academy Film Award and five Emmy Awards. She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.</p><p>Drew Barrymore also founded a production company Flower Films which has produced several projects in which she has starred. She has also authored an autography titled Little Girl Lost and a book with a collection of autobiographical essays titled Wildflower. She has also been hosting her own daytime show The Drew Barrymore Show since 2020.</p><p>The Charlie's Angels star has managed to have a wide body of work despite having a very unstable life. She got addicted to drugs and alcohol as a child and when she grew up, she had a major relationship crisis when she let herself go and packed on too many pounds for her comfort. She recently said that her body is constantly going through circles of weight gain and weight loss. Because she was looking fit as she said, people want to know more about weight gain.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>weight gain</a></strong> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Adam Lambert</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gina Carano</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h2>Drew Barrymore's Weight Gain: What Did The Actress Do For Weight Loss?</h2><p>It can be unbelievable for some people now to know that <strong>Drew Barrymore</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@drewbarrymore</a>) was, at a certain point in her life, less than perfect. With that tumultuous childhood she had and the alcohol and drug issues she had to deal with, Drew had it hard so hardly anyone expected this turn that her life took. She has now turned into a warm person with such great vibes. She has been a great person overall who is well-spoken and is unafraid of telling things like it is. And recently, she talked about her physical fitness journey and how hard it is to bounce back after the weight gain.</p><p>Drew Barrymore's weight gain was not very recent. It was about a year and a half ago in December 2020, right on the heels of the pandemic peak. And the actress, like a lot of people, happened to be dealing with her own Covid-15 (weight gain during the quarantine). She shared that she had packed a few extra pounds in a light-hearted way in an Instagram video.</p><p>The Screams star began the video she posted on December 3rd in her wardrobe closet and talked about the 'cute pictures they do.' And then, keeping it real about those cute pictures, she turned around to reveal that her adorable skirt didn't fit her anymore and she had to have a piece of elastic added to her skirt to fit her.</p><p>Drew Barrymore then talked about her weight gain, and how it happened because she had been eating her stress a little bit then. She also showed some love to the people who might have gained a few extra pounds during the pandemic and had to put an extender on their pants. She <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>,</p><p>“So, I’m going to reevaluate my life this weekend, and for anyone who has to put an extender on your pants, well, just know, I feel ya!”</p><p>This was the time Drew Barrymore took her weight gain in stride, which was not the case about six years ago in 2016 when she gained a few pounds after her divorce. She had apparently been comfort-eating which went out of control as a result of which she went up two jean sizes. On Andy Cohen Live, she <a href=# rel=noopener>shared</a>,</p><p>"I had gained a lot of weight. I had lost my way. I was going through a really difficult divorce [with Will Kopelman] in that it just was the worst thing and everything I didn’t want to happen."</p><p>However, the actress underwent weight loss soon after for her zombie series Santa Clarita Diet. She shared that she was inspired to lose weight by her the character she played in the series, Sheila who develops a strange illness that made her crave human meat. It came just in time for her when she was coming from an emotional crisis in her life during which she had let herself go and had that weight gain.</p><p>About the weight loss, Drew Barrymore revealed that she shed 20 pounds to get into fighting shape by training under the supervision of her longtime trainer <strong>Marnie Alton</strong>. She also shared that she takes a probiotic <a href=# rel=noopener>supplement</a> and enjoys a big glass of lemon-infused water because 'it's a great way to jump-start your body for the day.' She also did <a href=# rel=noopener>mention</a> that her diet didn't constitute human meat unlike Sheila's even though that would probably work, which is a relief in hindsight.</p><p>Since then, the 50 First Dates actress has been going in circles of weight gain and weight loss depending on whether she's filming or not. During her appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, she <a href=# rel=noopener>explained</a> the method she had subscribed to what she called the 'Denzel' method under which she simply follows a weight loss diet and workout schedule until filming,</p><p>“When I’m doing the show, I’m a vegan and I barely eat anything, and I work out every day, and it’s so healthy. It gets to be euphoric, and then it’s like food poisoning, you feel like you’ll never eat again, and then before you know it, you’re pigging out with the feed bag strapped to your face. I’m a foodie and love food and I travel the world for food, so I get heavy again between the show.”</p><p>Drew Barrymore, as it turns out, has not just followed a weight loss diet and workout schedule and taken supplements to stay in shape but she also got a little help from a weight loss <a href=# rel=noopener>treatment</a> called EmSculpt, a non-invasive procedure that stimulates your abdominal muscles with electromagnetic pulses to force muscular contractions, to 'not look like a bus' and not have that kind of weight gain.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGibq52nYq%2BivtGypKiqlWLEprXGoatmn5Geu3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barbara-britton-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-23355-html.html><span>←</span><span>Barbara Britton Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
