The Normal People star caught the “Kyoto” singer’s eye in the spring of 2020 after she finished binge-watching the Emmy-nominated Hulu series, which also starred Daisy Edgar-Jones.
“Finished normal people and now I’m sad and horny oh wait,” Bridgers teased via Twitter at the time.

Though she didn’t tag Mescal in her post, he chimed in with a cheeky response, replying, “I’m officially dead.”</p><p>Soon after their flirty social media exchange, the pair cohosted an Instagram Live conversation for Wonderland magazine. By December 2020, Mescal had starred in <a href=#>one of Bridgers’ music videos</a>. When asked how the project came about, the “I Know the End” singer credited the Irish actor with the idea.</p><p>“He broached it. He was like, ‘I’m a fan of yours, let’s make something cool,'” she told British Vogue in December 2020. “And he told me about the Rolling Stones video [he did for ‘Scarlet’], and then I brought it to <a href=#><strong>Phoebe</strong></a> [<a href=#><strong>Waller-Bridge</strong></a>] and she was like, ‘Yeah, it’s too serendipitous to not do it, the fact that I told you to watch Normal People and now you guys are friends.'”</p><p>Waller-Bridge directed the video and had previously agreed to meet the “Georgia” artist for drinks before the <a href=#>coronavirus pandemic</a> hit in early 2020. When their plans fell through, the <a href=#>Fleabag</a> creator encouraged the “Savior Complex” artist to watch Mescal’s hit show.</p><p>“I was like, ‘I’m not going to do that, it’s too depressing,'” Bridgers told the outlet. “I had read the book while making the record and it really destroyed me for a couple of days. Their performances are beautiful, but I can’t deal with it [laughs]. I had to skip the whole prom s–t, because it destroyed me already once in my life.”</p><p>Ahead of their music video collab, fans began to wonder whether the indie singer and the actor had sparked a <a href=#>romantic connection</a> when Bridgers was spotted overseas. The then-rumored couple were caught canoodling at a local cafe in July 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though they each continued to drop subtle hints about their respective relationship statuses, it wasn’t until November 2021 that the pair <a href=#>attended their first official event</a> together. Bridgers took the next step one month later, <a href=#>confirming their romance</a> with a PDA pic on Instagram.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the low-key couple’s whirlwind romance:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvam7xJucZpqinrGosdGsZKmZpaF6rrHSnJilq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luna-the-noodle-domain-6-videos-and-pictures-who-is-lunathenoodle-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>Luna The Noodle Twitter Videos and Pictures Who is LunaTheNoodle TikTok?
