Sasha Raspopina was among them.</p><p>MTV Russia appeared at&nbsp;an opportune moment in&nbsp;1998, when musical TV in&nbsp;Russia was limited to&nbsp;MuzTV, which at&nbsp;the time was a&nbsp;young and&nbsp;not very successful network. Other channels, like ORT, offered music shows too&nbsp;— but they were only a&nbsp;small part of&nbsp;the programming and&nbsp;never specifically addressed teenagers as the&nbsp;target audience. That's why when MTV Russia burst onto almost every TV set in&nbsp;the country it caused a&nbsp;true pop culture storm. With their music videos, goofy American shows, cartoons like "Beavis and&nbsp;Butt-head," and&nbsp;show business news with young, edgy anchors, the&nbsp;channel knew how to&nbsp;get kids to&nbsp;like it. No dead-faced people in&nbsp;suits, no soap operas that your gran follows, but plenty of&nbsp;Backstreet Boys and&nbsp;Spice Girls videos, top-10 music charts, and&nbsp;fart jokes from&nbsp;two of&nbsp;the most annoying cartoon characters in&nbsp;the world. If there was a&nbsp;more ingenious plan to&nbsp;take over a&nbsp;generation of&nbsp;13-year-olds in&nbsp;a turbulent country less than 10 years old, it hadn't been invented yet.</p><p>Celebrity culture and&nbsp;pop music were finally here after years of&nbsp;perestroika-fuelled cravings for&nbsp;all things shimmering and&nbsp;Western. Some older people had an&nbsp;issue with this&nbsp;— how could we ignore 70 years of&nbsp;communism for&nbsp;songs about sex and&nbsp;money? Did the&nbsp;history mean nothing at&nbsp;all? But while they may have had a&nbsp;point, they were wrong to&nbsp;think the&nbsp;new pop culture a&nbsp;successor to&nbsp;the traditional Soviet <i>kultura</i>, an&nbsp;exalted sphere that favored education and&nbsp;ideology over entertainment. This was about entertainment for&nbsp;its own sake, something we had never really experienced before. Because it was new, we imported it just like we imported chocolate bars at&nbsp;the time. The&nbsp;language difference in&nbsp;the song lyrics wasn't a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;— if anything, it helped us learn English faster than our parents could ever have dreamed. And&nbsp;later, when we started to&nbsp;produce our own versions, the&nbsp;original American product, be it Mars bars or Justin Timberlake, served as a&nbsp;handy guide that could be either copied completely or rearranged to&nbsp;look and&nbsp;sound more Russia-appropriate.</p><p></p><p><span><span>Video for&nbsp;1999 track "Party at&nbsp;Detsl's Home"/"Vecherinka u Detsla"</span></span></p><p>In&nbsp;2002 the&nbsp;channel started 24-hour broadcast, pouring tunes and&nbsp;visuals straight into&nbsp;the minds of&nbsp;the fresh post-Soviet teenagers, who had grown up eating Snickers bars in&nbsp;the bleak school yards of&nbsp;the '90s. The&nbsp;country was busy rebuilding itself and&nbsp;MTV was there to&nbsp;babysit the&nbsp;kids procrastinating from&nbsp;doing their math homework. The&nbsp;videos and&nbsp;music we saw then stuck with us for&nbsp;a long time&nbsp;— as many first experiences do. Go out on&nbsp;the street of&nbsp;Moscow now, grab a&nbsp;twenty-something and&nbsp;read them the&nbsp;first line of&nbsp;the chorus of&nbsp;Detsl's '99 hit Vecherinka (Party) and&nbsp;they will be able to&nbsp;continue: "Party's at&nbsp;full swing at&nbsp;Detsl's house; All the&nbsp;boys and&nbsp;girls from&nbsp;the district are here."</p><p>At&nbsp;the time MTV acted as an&nbsp;incubator for&nbsp;young talent. We had our first rappers and&nbsp;hip-hop artists: Detsl (real name Kirill Tolmachev), Master Cheff (Vlad Valov) and&nbsp;the band Malchishnik&nbsp;— all of&nbsp;them white and&nbsp;painfully awkward, trying out a&nbsp;kitschy post-Soviet Eminem persona. We got Strelki, Blestyashchiye, VIA Gra and&nbsp;other girl groups, as well as a&nbsp;legion of&nbsp;boy bands. Then came Russian X Factor graduates, Black Eyed Peas-style bands, Madonna-wannabes&nbsp;— we've seen them all. Half of&nbsp;the time the&nbsp;quality of&nbsp;these freshly manufactured acts was questionable, so most kids naturally preferred to&nbsp;see an&nbsp;Avril Lavigne video instead of&nbsp;one by&nbsp;Yulia Savicheva, a&nbsp;pop singer similarly longing for&nbsp;a rock-pop princess aesthetic. Sometimes this preference for&nbsp;the imported and&nbsp;foreign became automatic, but a&nbsp;clever rotation schedule on&nbsp;the channel meant that we got to&nbsp;have our imported desserts while our homegrown greens were sneaked in&nbsp;as well. A&nbsp;true triumph was the&nbsp;swift rise to&nbsp;fame of&nbsp;the pretend-lesbian duo t.A.T.u., whose videos were rotated heavily on&nbsp;MTV and&nbsp;paired with clever marketing from&nbsp;the band's team, resulting in&nbsp;the holy grail of&nbsp;all Russian musicians&nbsp;— mild worldwide success. In&nbsp;fact the&nbsp;band still has a&nbsp;sizable fanbase all over the&nbsp;world, despite one member's recent <a href=#>homophobic claims</a>.</p><p>?&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>Video for&nbsp;2002 track "Hottie"/"Krasavchik" by&nbsp;Strelki</span></span></p><p>The&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;quality of&nbsp;our domestic pop product compared to&nbsp;the foreign artists wasn't even important. As long as we got our own stuff, we were moving forward. Detsl's 2001 song and&nbsp;video "Pismo" (Letter) copies Eminem's "Stan" visually and&nbsp;conceptually, as Tolmachev raps that he received a&nbsp;letter from&nbsp;a depressed suicidal fan in&nbsp;a small town on&nbsp;the Volga river. In&nbsp;Vecherinka, the&nbsp;video uses all the&nbsp;typical wild teenager party tropes&nbsp;— but instead of&nbsp;the parents going out of&nbsp;town as they would in&nbsp;a similar American song, Detsl specifies that the&nbsp;parents went to&nbsp;the dacha, prompting a&nbsp;party with all the&nbsp;cool kids from&nbsp;the rayon (region in&nbsp;Russian). These local details and&nbsp;other cultural signifiers, although seemingly tiny, meant a&nbsp;great deal in&nbsp;the end, identifying small Russian towns and&nbsp;suburbs together with their American analogues, both romanticizing them and&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;new context, where, suddenly, we were on&nbsp;the map. "Petersburg, I'm Yours" by&nbsp;Bad Balance, a&nbsp;hip-hop band formerly known as Bad B. Alliance and&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;Detsl, is one of&nbsp;those songs where a&nbsp;rapper confesses love to&nbsp;his home city. Suddenly, St. Petersburg was no longer mundane, imperial, post-Soviet: it had street cred, like Los Angeles and&nbsp;New York. Easy.</p><p></p><p><span><span>Video for&nbsp;2000 track "Hope for&nbsp;Tomorrow"/"Nadezhda na zavtra" by&nbsp;Bad B. Alliance</span></span></p><p>These artists found a&nbsp;way into&nbsp;the hearts of&nbsp;teenagers, who still hold them dear even as they've grown up and&nbsp;lost interest in&nbsp;music. A&nbsp;tweet comparing Detsl to&nbsp;Eminem provokes a&nbsp;whole queue of&nbsp;replies favoring the&nbsp;former, despite the&nbsp;fact that an&nbsp;independent critic would conclude that the&nbsp;American rapper has better songwriting and&nbsp;production. The&nbsp;recent death of&nbsp;Zhanna Friske, an&nbsp;ex-member of&nbsp;the girl group Blestyashchiye, was met with a&nbsp;mourning reserved only for&nbsp;childhood heroes, as Facebook filled up with tearful emotional posts, even from&nbsp;people who now boast elitist tastes in&nbsp;trendy electronica.</p><p></p><p><span><span>Video for&nbsp;1997 track "Clouds"/"Oblaka" by&nbsp;Blestyashchiye, the&nbsp;year Zhanna Friske joined</span></span></p><p>Sadly the&nbsp;phenomenon didn't last: In&nbsp;May 2013 MTV Russia left the&nbsp;airwaves and&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;cable, ending an&nbsp;era. As the&nbsp;change was announced, media burst into&nbsp;a TV obituary frenzy, publishing lengthy op-eds about the&nbsp;channel's departure and&nbsp;legacy. Many authors pointed out the&nbsp;symbolic coincidence: The&nbsp;channel closed just when Russia was starting its transition into&nbsp;newly conservative times with strong state influence on&nbsp;culture, where MTV's fun and&nbsp;riskiness had no place. Alexandra Garmazhapova, a&nbsp;St. Petersburg-based political journalist for&nbsp;Novaya Gazeta wrote: "Every time I read the&nbsp;news with the&nbsp;words 'banned,' 'prohibited,' 'outlawed,' I'm happy my childhood was in&nbsp;the '90s and&nbsp;'00s. My generation was lucky&nbsp;— we grew up in&nbsp;a free country. Poor but free. We listened to&nbsp;trashy music (thanks to&nbsp;MTV and&nbsp;MuzTV) …, girls from&nbsp;my class wore tartan skirts and&nbsp;skinny neckties to&nbsp;school imitating t.A.T.u. … They even took part in&nbsp;the school contest signing the&nbsp;band's song 'Gay Boy.' They didn't win because the&nbsp;teachers said the&nbsp;song was inappropriate and&nbsp;the class was outraged&nbsp;— what was inappropriate about that song? … Back then it felt like our submarine was in&nbsp;trouble but we knew we'd resurface. Now it feels like we're stationed on&nbsp;the very bottom of&nbsp;the ocean … knowing we won't breath fresh air any time soon."</p><p>?&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>t.A.T.u. performing their 2002 hit "Gay Boy"/"Malchik Gay"</span></span></p><p>MTV Russia's disappearance from&nbsp;public TV is not so much a&nbsp;cultural loss (no one watches TV on&nbsp;actual TV sets now anyway) as a&nbsp;moral and&nbsp;psychological one. New times call not only for&nbsp;new heroes but also for&nbsp;new means, as the&nbsp;old ones depart. Perhaps teenagers now will find their equivalent of&nbsp;MTV Russia online. But the&nbsp;generation of&nbsp;us that grew up with the&nbsp;channel used it as a&nbsp;metaphorical window to&nbsp;look out on&nbsp;the wonderful and&nbsp;screwed up world of&nbsp;pop stars. At&nbsp;least we learned our fair share of&nbsp;Britney lyrics and&nbsp;the perfect pitch for&nbsp;the "Beavis and&nbsp;Butt-head" laugh&nbsp;— and&nbsp;if people tell you this wasn't important, don't believe them.</p><p><i>This article first appeared in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Calvert Journal</a>, a&nbsp;guide to&nbsp;the new east.<br></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpqasm5%2Bswaq5xKxlnKedZK6zr8eirZ5nlKS6pr%2FToppmqKKksbav02afqK9dosG3edGuqqyhkWLAqa3PnptmmV2stbC4xGaenqaVp661tc6n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dalton-penkacik-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Dalton Penkacik Accident, Dalton Penkacik Passes Away In A Hit-And-Run Accident, What happened</span></a>
