And now, she has one.”</p><p>Jones, 45, went on to joke that speculation about her belly button has turned into an “urban legend,” adding, “People in Philly who are watching are like, ‘Oh yeah, we lived this with her.’”</p><p>Containing his laughter, Melvin, 44, proceeded to ask his colleague, “So do you or do you not actually have a belly button?” Jones responded, “I have one, but we had to tweak it a little.”</p><p><strong>Dylan Dreyer</strong> chimed in, noting that the discussion “is a radio conversation.” Agreeing with her cohost, Jones teased that her belly button changed “when I had the twins. … If you saw me, you would never know.” (Jones shares son Kayin, 14, and twins Clara and Uche Jr., 11, with her husband, <strong>Uche Ojeh</strong>.)</p><p>“Oh, it’s a medical thing? But you’re OK?” Melvin asked Jones before she playfully slapped him and Roker, 69, with her pages of notes. Cracking up once again, Melvin asked Dreyer to “take over” introducing their first topic of discussion.</p><p>A day before the hilarious belly button discussion, Jones revealed that she <a href=#>suffered a recent injury</a> while running errands. “So, true story, Sunday after I went running, I had some friends come over. And I was like, ‘Oh, let me run and get some things.’ And I’m running down the street, and I fall on my face in New York City,” she said in a Tuesday, April 2, <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video. “And so, I’m just bringing you behind the scenes, here. The last couple [of] days, after the show, I have been icing my knees.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Third-Hour-Today-Hosts-Crack-up-Over-Rumors-About-Sheinelle-Jones-Not-Having-a-Belly-Button-02.jpg><p>Showing off her “out of control bruises,” she continued: “I did a whole marathon situation, never hurt myself, and then I’m running out of the Dollar Store with plastic plates and paper plates and running to Insomnia [Cookies] to get some cookies for my friends and fall on my face in front of everybody in the middle of the street.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the fall, which also left her with a scrape on her chin, Jones said her mantra was to “be more mindful of how I move.”</p><p>Jones has been working double duty on Today this week, filling in for <strong>Carson Daly</strong> on the show’s first two hours in addition to her regular third hour hosting gig. She took a brief hiatus from the NBC morning show last month to take a spring break trip to Puerto Rico with her family. Saturday Today cohost <strong>Laura Jarrett</strong> <a href=#>filled in</a> for Jones, as well as <strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong> and <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong>, who were also <a href=#>on spring break</a>.</p><p>Jones captioned <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> clips and pics from her tropical getaway: “7 days in 7 seconds ☺️ We traded NYC traffic for some family time in the sun. We were all hoping we’d fly back and land to find warmer weather … nope! 😭 Aw well. See you soon! ☀️.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuonJGuwG6%2Fx56gp52cobJuts6nnKxlo53Ctb%2BMnaawpl2nwq670WaqoZ1dmbymv82tZKGZppp6o7HLpbBmmqWpwbC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nfl-100-at-no-39-ed-reed-was-every-quarterbacks-no-1-concern.html><span>←</span><span>NFL 100: At No. 39, Ed Reed was every quarterbacks No. 1 concern</span></a>
