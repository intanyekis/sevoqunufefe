So incredible sad.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>What’s even more sad is that Katie has a beautiful 7-year-old daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Mia.&nbsp;</strong>A GoFundMe page has been set up, taking donations to help support the little girl’s education and more, but this is such a tragic loss for Katie’s adorable daughter. Katie’s last message on Instagram was a positive one, posted just hours before the stroke. “Hope everyone is having a great Monday!” she captioned a sexy photo of herself. Out hearts are with her family and loved ones during this awful time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you shocked that a fall at a photo shoot could’ve had such a drastic effect on Katie?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH1ze49uZqSZpJ6ybrnAsmSdnZGptW6vwK6qnmWjqb%2Bwt8RmnZqknGK9qbvTqGSsoJ%2BkwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rashaan-salaam.html><span>←</span><span>Rashaan Salaam</span></a>
