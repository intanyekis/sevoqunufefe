David Brandt, the Ohio farmer who became a viral meme after espousing the virtues of “honest work,” has died after being involved in a car crash in Illinois. He was 76.
The fatal accident occurred Thursday while Brandt was on a seed-selling trip in Urbana. He reportedly succumbed to his injuries this past Sunday.
A pioneer in the field of sustainable agriculture, the 50-year farming veteran is perhaps best known for comments he made during a 2012 Natural Resources Conservation Service event held on his 736-acre farm outside Carroll, the Associated Press reported."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
