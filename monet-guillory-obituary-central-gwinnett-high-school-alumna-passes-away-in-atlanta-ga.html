She stated that:</p><p>Damn this is hard. I‚Äôm Still In disbelief. My family and I we‚Äôre introduced to you by our baby sister Lala Cunningham in your teenage years. You were they only one we trusted her to go out with. Over the years you became literal family to all of us! I grew to love you like a litter sister. Always wanting to protect you and la. Through the years we acted as such going months without speaking because we are all so stubborn and reconciling our differences and coming back together like family. You always said we were the sisters and brothers you never had. You were just as crazy as all of us and always loved by the whole family down to the pets. You always made time during holidays to make sure you got a plate or plates of moms delicious spread. Mon√©t Guillory We are going to miss you. Fly High and look over us all.
