The 24-year-old rapper got major buzz in 2020 for the song “Whats Poppin’,” which hit number two on the Billboard Music Charts. He also gained more popularity after his first-ever appearance on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live </a>in March 2021, alongside host and former SNL&nbsp;cast member <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maya Rudolph</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jack is also going to be seen on tons of TVs on Thanksgiving 2023, as he performs the halftime show for the Detroit Lions game against the Green Bay Packers. The Lions have hosted a Thanksgiving game every&nbsp; year since 1934, so Jack is participating in a major tradition. Ahead of the game, the rapper has made appearances on the team’s social media and&nbsp;Monday Night Football,&nbsp;per&nbsp;Billboard.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>This isn’t the first time that Jack has gotten involved in the NFL. The musician starred in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl commercial</a> with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Missy Elliot</strong></a>, back in February. The ad is for the chip brand Doritos and shows Jack exploring a “new angle” and flavor.

Since living there, he’s worked with legends like <strong>DJ Drama</strong> and <strong>Don Cannon</strong>, who signed him to their label. “I’m doing a much better job of representing who I am off record, on record,” he said of the move. “I don’t know if [credibility] is a requirement to have success, but it’s important to me,” he said to GQ. “When I was shopping around before I signed I wasn’t like, ‘I’m not signing until I find some Black gatekeepers.’ But I’m proud to be signed to them,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/who-is-Jack-Harlow-shutterstock-post.jpg><h2>Jack Harlow’s Been Nominated for Six Grammys</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jack has been nominated for a total of six <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy Awards</a> during his career.
