The show centers around survivors of a zombie apocalypse as they learn that the undead are not the most dangerous beings out there. Fans love the intense drama of the show, and the added fear factor only makes it better. The show has already inspired one spinoff show, but now that The Walking Dead has ended, even more spin-offs are in the works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Norman Reedus has starred in The Walking Dead since its beginning. Reedus plays Daryl Dixon, and fans have loved watching his character grow over the course of the show. Now that the hit television show has ended, Reedus is moving on to new projects. Here’s what Norman Reedus has planned for after The Walking Dead.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What The Future Looks Like For These Walking Dead Stars After The Show’s Finale</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-norman-reedus><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Norman Reedus?</span></h2><p>Norman Reedus is an American Actor best known for <a href=#>his portrayal of Daryl Dixon in the horror drama series </a><a href=#>The Walking Dead</a>. He was one of the original members of the cast and remained on the show until its end this year. Reedus also is known for his role in 1999 film The Boondock Saints. While continuing to star in The Walking Dead, Reedus has also made guest appearances in other television shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reedus was married to Helena Christensen from 1998 to 2003. They have one son together and have remained friends to co-parent their child. Reedus is currently married to Diane Kruger. They have a daughter together.</p><h2 id=norman-reedus-in-the-walking-dead><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Norman Reedus In The Walking Dead</span></h2><p>Norman Reedus first appeared in the hit horror drama show The Walking Dead in 2010. His character, Daryl Dixon, was introduced to the show in the third episode of season one, which was titled ‘Tell It to the Frogs.’ Reedus continued to star in the zombie television show until its final episode of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reedus’s character sustained many injuries over the course of the show, but one specific injury had to be written in due to an accident Reedus had in 2005. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reedus had a head injury from a car accident in Germany</a>, and his left eye socket is made of titanium. His nose also had to be reconstructed.</p><h2 id=why-did-andrew-lincoln-leave-the-walking-dead><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Did Andrew Lincoln Leave The Walking Dead?</span></h2><p>When The Walking Dead first premiered in 2010, the lead of the show was actor Andrew Lincoln. He played Rick Grimes and was the center of the show for nine seasons. Since the show filmed in Atlanta, Georgia, Lincoln spent most of the year away from his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the ninth season, Lincoln chose to step away from the show. The actor wanted to spend more time with his family, and he was confident the other actors and actresses could continue the television show without him. Lincoln is not the only actor to leave a leading role in a television show and have it continue without him. <a href=#>Nina Dobrev stepped away from her role as Elena Gilbert in </a><a href=#>The Vampire Diaries</a> and the show had two seasons without her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is There Still Going To Be A Walking Dead Movie?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-the-walking-dead-end><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Did The Walking Dead End?</span></h2><p>The conflict involving Laila Collin’s character Pamela was resolved by the main characters freeing her prisoners and taking her under arrest. A flash forward gives the viewers and characters a sense of hope that the world is much more at peace than what has previously been depicted in the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The characters were able to have the perfect final moments together. Andrew Lincoln, the original lead of the show, made an appearance. His appearance was not relevant to the plot, however, as it was more of a set up for his upcoming spinoff.</p><h2 id=norman-reedus-hated-a-line-in-the-walking-dead-finale><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Norman Reedus Hated A Line In The Walking Dead Finale</span></h2><p>Norman Reedus did not like one specific scene from the final episode of the series. During the climax, Reedus’s character Daryl Dixon says the title of the show, and Reedus was not happy about it.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They kind of talked me into saying it</a>,” Reedus told Vanity Fair. “So I kind of just incorporated it into the dialogue, and I didn’t want to shout it from the rooftops.” Reedus specifically did not want to copy Andrew Lincoln’s previous delivery of the line, “so I had to figure out a way to just make it a part of the sentence without making it a poster.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=norman-reedus-rsquo-projects-outside-the-walking-dead><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Norman Reedus’ Projects Outside The Walking Dead</span></h2><p>While continuing to star in The Walking Dead, Norman Reedus has made it a habit to step away from his character Daryl Dixon every now and then. The actor does this by making guest appearances in other television shows. He has also appeared in short films and in music videos over the years. Reedus plans to continue doing this going forward.</p><p>Reedus’s first project after the end of The Walking Dead will be the film The Bikeriders. The film will follow the lives of a motorcycle club from the Midwest. Other actors involved in the project include Tom Hardy, Austin Butler, and Michael Shannon.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Happened To Sarah Wayne Callies After ‘The Walking Dead’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=norman-reedus-will-star-in-the-walking-dead-daryl-dixon><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Norman Reedus Will Star In The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon</span></h2><p>While The Walking Dead is coming to an end after eleventh impressive years, Norman Reedus is not yet ready to say goodbye to his character Daryl Dixon. The character has been a part of the actor’s life for over a decade, and fans are overjoyed that they do not have to say goodbye quite yet.</p><p>Reedus has been given a spin-off series titled The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. The show will take place in France, and Reedus is very excited about the project. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s very different</a>,” the actor said of the spin-off. “It's different in tone. It's different in photography style. It sounds different. I'm shooting in castles and stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-are-the-new-the-walking-dead-spin-offs><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Are The New The Walking Dead Spin-offs?</span></h2><p>Norman Reedus’s spin-off of The Walking Dead is not the only spin-off show in production. <a href=#>The network has launched three total spin-offs</a> to continue the world of The Walking Dead, and fans could not be happier about the news.</p><p>Andrew Lincoln, the original lead of The Walking Dead, is returning to the zombie universe. He will be joined by Danai Gurira in an untitled spin-off series. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Lauren Cohen will also be given their own show, titled The Walking Dead: Dead City. These shows, along with Norman Reedus’s show and the spin-off shows already on air, are set to premiere in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiumqSbnruoecOemJ1lmJbAbrHNnZydZZKqwW60xKucrGWnna61ec2oqaaZnmK%2FprHDrqpmoJGoerG4wKelnpxdo7K5wI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richard-sammel-dating-girlfriend-children-net-worth-age-height-wiki-bio.html><span>←</span><span>Richard Sammel Dating, Girlfriend, Children, Net Worth, Age, Height, Wiki, Bio</span></a>
