Stapp had been on a 3-day drug and alcohol binge at the Delano Hotel on South Beach. At one point, Scott started hallucinating and thought police were coming to arrest him. Fearing that he would end up embarrassing his family, the drug induced rocker tried to escape through the balcony and plummeted 40 feet onto the concrete.</p><p>Minutes later, <a href=# id=auto-tag_t-i_3 data-tag=t-i>T.I.</a> just happened to be walking by and discovered an injured Stapp with a broken hip, fractured skull, and other serious injuries. Tip wasted no time in saving his old friend.</p><p>“I had met T.I. back in 2004, we were both writing songs for The Passion of The Christ: Songs Inspired By soundtrack and we had briefly interacted there and knew what each looked like,” he revealed. “We’d talked about being fans of Alabama.”</p><p>The rocker says everything happened by chance.</p><p>“It’s ironic — he walked in, and I found out later it was the only room left in the hotel and he came in off the street and came out, and as I’m laying on the ledge, blood fell to [T.I.’s] feet and he looked up and he had an Alabama hat on. I said, ‘roll tide,’ and then he looked at me and put two and two together and really saved my life.”</p><p><strong>Watch Stapp tell the story in his own words below:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iwsMDTZqqtmaCleqK6w2arZqFdqMKqr8idnGarkauypXnLop2eZWFmgXKBkGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mom-and-her-crying-baby-asked-to-leave-first-class-w458825.html><span>←</span><span>Mom and Her Crying Baby Asked to Leave First Class</span></a>
