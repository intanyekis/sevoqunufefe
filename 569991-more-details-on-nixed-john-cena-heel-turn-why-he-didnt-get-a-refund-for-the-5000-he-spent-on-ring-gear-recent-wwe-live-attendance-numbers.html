John Cena&nbsp;revealed during his WWE&nbsp;Network podcast interview with&nbsp;Chris Jericho&nbsp;that he was very close to turning heel during his Wrestlemania XXVIII feud&nbsp;with&nbsp;The Rock.&nbsp;
Cena said he was close enough that he recorded new entrance music and had new ring gear designed, which reportedly cost him $5,000 to have made by seamstress Sue Kotulski. Cena ended up cancelling the order before Kotulski completed it, and asked her to use the money towards WWE developmental ring gear instead of giving him a refund."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
