A major change with this year's festival is the location of the main stage. The location <a href=# title=https://treefortmusicfest.com/ class=themeColorForLinks>Treefort</a> used to use as its main area is being turned into residential apartments, so Treefort has moved most of its forts into Julia Davis Park.</p><p>Another addition to the festival is <a href=# title=https://treefortmusichall.com/ class=themeColorForLinks>Treefort Music Hall</a>, which will also double as a headquarters for Treefort. It's located in the heart of downtown, attached to <a href=# title=https://www.warehouseboise.com/ class=themeColorForLinks>The Warehouse Food Hall</a>, on the corner of Capitol and Broad.</p><p>Festival Director and CEO of <a href=# title=https://theduckclub.com/ class=themeColorForLinks>Duck Club Entertainment</a>, Eric Gilbert, said the space will enable Treefort's team to have a year-round presence.</p><p>"It just gives us more of a hub, like a year-round hub," Gilbert said.</p><p>Gilbert noted that the location was a big part of why the team decided to make it their headquarters.</p><p>"We're excited about the location," Gilbert said. "It's really cool. We're right on Capitol Boulevard. It's really visible, it's right like I said, it's in the heart of Boise... Treefort is very downtown Boise-centric, so it was important to us as well to have our headquarters be right in the middle of it all."</p><p>Gilbert mentioned that in previous years, the team had to work out of a variety of locations.</p><p>"We've done a lot of meetings in coffee shops and a variety of spaces, so this feels like the first kind of real office that we've had," Gilbert said.<br></p><p>Treefort Music Hall had been a concept for several years, with the original idea dating back to the early 2010s when festival co-founder Lori Shandro envisioned a music space in the center of Boise.</p><p>Shandro pitched the idea with Gilbert suggesting they focus on a music festival, which ended up becoming the first Treefort in 2012. Years later, the team was able to revisit the idea, and work toward getting a permanent venue in downtown.</p><p>Treefort Music Hall is not fully completed, but the space is concert-ready. Gilbert said that most concert-goers will be impressed when they see the venue, and that it's set to be complete sometime in June or July. He added that it will have a rooftop lounge when it's fully built.</p><p>Gilbert remarked on the festival's growth, looking at how the original idea blossomed into a five-day festival with hundreds of bands.</p><p>"I called it a 3-day small festival with 60 bands, and here we are today with a five-day festival with over 500 bands," Gilbert said. "And so, it's kind of cool that now it's come full circle. Over those ten years, we've been able to distill a lot of ideas, and a lot of things. About five years ago, we started working on the idea of owning our own venue again, and that came to fruition just a few days ago."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihlJa1sLrEsKpnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxmpaeTlrlwwNGenJ%2Bnoql6rsHSoppmnpWowarCwKVkqKiVo8BuusSwZKato56wbrTApaNmnJWXwrW%2F</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todays-sheinelle-jones-shuts-down-rumor-she-doesnt-have-belly-button.html><span>←</span><span>Today's Sheinelle Jones Shuts Down Rumor She Doesn't Have Belly Button</span></a>
