While you probably have your favorite and least favorite character, you probably also have couples you ship, and couples you hate. However, how much do you know about the cast IRL?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Friends' Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In case you were ever hoping to date one of these characters at Central Perk, or simply are a bit too nosy, we thought we'd make a list about the cast and their relationships in the real world. Since it's been a while since the '90s, here are the main characters from the show, and their real life ages and current relationship status.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer>David Schwimmer</h2><p>While true fans of the show will know that Ross has two different birthdays, David only has one, and was born on November 2nd, 1966, and is currently 53 years old. David married his wifey, Zoe Buckman, in 2010, and they have one daughter together.</p><p>However, the couple announced in 2017 that they were "taking a break". Uh oh, right? They're still not officially separated, so the verdict is still out on whether David is truly single or not. However, we're definitely not going to ask Rachel about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courteney-cox>Courteney Cox</h2><p>Courteney Cox is actually older than her brother on the show IRL, and was born on June 15th, 1964, making her 55 years young. She was married to David Arquette from 1999-2013, and you might even remember the episode where all the characters had "Arquette" attached to their names in the opening credits, in celebration of Courteney's wedding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Jennifer Aniston Movies Of All-Time</a></span></p><p>Now, she's said to be dating Johnny McDaid, a musician, since 2013. We hope to see more from this couple, because we're all pretty big fans of Monica.</p><h2 id=james-michael-tyler>James Michael Tyler</h2><p>We love James Michael Tyler as Gunther, and he will always be this character in our hearts. James was born on May 28th, 1962, making him the oldest of the gang at Central Perk, at 57 years old.</p><p>He was married to Barbara Chadsey from 1995-2014, but is apparently still single and ready to mingle. He has no kids from his first marriage, and we're guessing he's still looking for that special lady. So, your chance to be with Gunther is still open and alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-kudrow>Lisa Kudrow</h2><p>Lisa Kudrow has become iconic as Phoebe Buffay. She's the oldest friend, actually, but she's still a bombshell. Her birthday is July 30th, 1963, and she's currently 56 years old.</p><p>She's been married to hubby Michel Stern (a French advertising executive) since 1995, and they have one son together. Her pregnancy was actually written into the show, when she acted as a surrogate for her half-brother. Their kid might just be older than you, though, and was born in 1998.</p><h2 id=paul-rudd>Paul Rudd</h2><p>Mike is our favorite secondary character, and we know you shipped him and Phoebe to the very end. IRL, this man was born on April 6th, 1969, and is currently at the big 50. He's also been married for quite some time, and him and his wifey (Julie Yaeger, who is a television producer and publicist) have two kids together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: A Quote From Each Character That Sums Up Their Personality</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They tied the knot in 2003, and their kids were born in 2004 and 2009, so they're not totally old yet. These two live together in New York, and are totally couple goals.</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc>Matt LeBlanc</h2><p>Matt is no one but Joey in our hearts, and this man is currently 52 years old. His birthday is July 25th, 1967, so you should be sure to celebrate it next time. He was married to Melissa McKnight from 2003-2006, and the couple had a daughter in 2004.</p><p>Now, Matt is rumored to be dating Aurora Mulligan, and apparently the couple has been together since 2016. Mulligan is a producer on Top Gear, and we hope to hear more from this couple soon.</p><h2 id=maggie-wheeler>Maggie Wheeler</h2><p>Maggie Wheeler is Janice through and through, and we love to hate this wild and hilarious character. Maggie is actually older than the friends though, and was born on August 7th, 1961.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Richest Friends Guest Stars, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's right, she's a Leo, and she's currently 58 years young. She has been married since 1990, to Daniel Borden Wheeler, and the couple has two kids together. Maggie was off-limits before the series even started, and we kind of love that. Of course, their kids aren't exactly kids, and are definitely grown up by now in 2019.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry>Matthew Perry</h2><p>Matthew Perry also just hit the big 50 this year, and was born on August 19th, 1969. He had a serious partner from 2006-2012, Lizzy Caplan, but the couple has been separated since.</p><p>He also actually dated Julia Roberts from 1995-1996, which should pique your interest if you remember her cameo on the show (you can check back to season 2 of the show to really blow your mind). Currently, though, Matthew is single, and there aren't even any girlfriend rumors in the midst. So, you still have a chance with Chandler.</p><h2 id=elliott-gould>Elliott Gould</h2><p>Elliot Gould is one of our favorite television dads, and plays the one and only Jack Geller. Jack is currently 81 years old, and this Virgo was born on August 29th, 1938.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was married to Barbara Streisand from 1963-1971 (mind-blown, we know), and was married to Jennifer Bogart twice, actually, from 1973-1975 and 1978-1979. He has one child with Streisand, and two children with Bogart. Of course, these children definitely aren't children anymore. Currently, Elliott is riding solo and living life.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston>Jennifer Aniston</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston definitely has a pretty impressive film career, but she will always be Rachel Green in our hearts. Jennifer also had her 50th birthday this year, and born on February 11th, 1969. We all know this brilliant and beautiful gal was married to Brad Pritt from 2000-2005, but she was also married to Justin Theroux (another popular actor) from 2015-2017.</p><p>Currently, this bombshell has no children from her marriages. As of now, Jennifer is living her best life, and there's no evidence that she currently has a man. However, her and Theroux are still on pretty good terms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWieop6yr7DSZqSaoZ5isKmt0ZqarZ2iqHqis8SsZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2owaLA1KycrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anderson-cooper-speaks-out-on-late-moms-1st-death-anniversary.html><span>←</span><span>Anderson Cooper Speaks Out on Late Moms 1st Death Anniversary</span></a>
