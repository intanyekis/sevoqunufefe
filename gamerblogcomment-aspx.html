Shortly after I decided to try out another Japanese title to make sure that it wasn't dying, and that title was <a href=#>The Idolm@ster: Live for You!</a>. Ok here goes a second apology in as many weeks but... what the hell, isn't Idolm@ster some giant thing that entrap men from their early teens up until their 80's... I was somewhat glad to have this one over and done with after 2 sessions. I don't think I would have had that much against it if the button noises weren't tacky and actually something that went with the songs.<p>I also kept going on <a href=#>Mortal Kombat X</a> after I picked up another copy of it cheap, well XL which allowed me to get the DLC, which to my surprise extends your Bean Dive even after you've locked in the games, makes sense. I'm unsure how the DLC works account wise, but initial issues may have suggested that I accidentally installed the DLC onto my second account, which I didn't think it would be an issue, but heck, silly fighting games have silly rules *cough* <a href=#>Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate</a> *cough* ... needing to download DLC to play the game otherwise the entire game is locked is stupid. Now I have to make a Japanese account and download the DLC, just to play the game.</p><p>In other Japanese news I managed to pick up a 360 Slim on Sunday for $30, technically I bought it for the power brick so that I don't have to swap power bricks with my Japanese 360 Slim, but I then noticed that it had a 250Gb expansion in it... score for $30.</p><p>Sadly at the start of the week I got kidnapped by Zelda: Breath of the Wild (primary reason this is being posted on a Saturday and not on Wednesday). I'm late to this game because I knew that it would absorb me and it did... really badly. I could talk about this game for weeks, but I'm sure ya'll heard it before. Anyhow I caught up to my wife's progress in 4 days (something that she said took her a few months), took down Thunderblight Ganon first attempt and really unprepared (for those that don't know, that's a very annoying fight). Considering the amount of time I put into it and not into achievement farming / Bean diving, I think I might just ignore that game for a few weeks before playing it again.</p><p>In other news, I'm going to also try to list stuff that I've picked up for cheap over the weeks as I'm trying to get to Flea Markets, Garage Sales and the like looking for retro games and xbox games. I picked up <a href=#>2006 FIFA World Cup</a> and <a href=#>Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</a> about an hour and a half ago for $5.50 each. I've been looking for that silly FIFA game for too long, could never find it. I'm going to a flea market tomorrow so I'm hoping there's something worth buying there tomorrow (totally inspired by Game Chasers *shakes fist*).</p><p><b>This weeks progress</b></p><p><b>Overview</b></p><br>Previous Post: <a href=#>Kysol's blog post - After a week of R&R, it's time to do this! | Bean Dive 2018 - Week 2</a> Posted by <a href=#>Kysol</a> on 04 August 18 at 08:01<p class=subtext>Share this blog</p><span class=twitter onclick='return oShare.Go("Gamer Blog",76171,"Twitter","https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&text=Check%2520out%2520this%2520gamer%2520blog%2520on%2520TrueAchievements+via+%40TrueAchievement+http%3a%2f%2fwww.trueachievements.com%2fgamerblogcomment.aspx%3fgamerblogid%3d76171",&#39;&#39;),!1' title="Share via Twitter"><span>Twitter </span><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></span><span class=reddit onclick='return oShare.Go("Gamer Blog",76171,"Reddit","http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.trueachievements.com%2fgamerblogcomment.aspx%3fgamerblogid%3d76171&title=Check%2520out%2520this%2520gamer%2520blog%2520on%2520TrueAchievements",&#39;&#39;),!1' title="Share via Reddit"><span>Reddit </span><i class="fa fa-reddit"></i></span><span class=email onclick='return oShare.Go("Gamer Blog",76171,"Email","mailto:?subject=Check%2520out%2520this%2520gamer%2520blog%2520on%2520TrueAchievements&body=http%3a%2f%2fwww.trueachievements.com%2fgamerblogcomment.aspx%3fgamerblogid%3d76171",&#39;&#39;),!1' title="Share via Email"><span>Email </span><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></span><span class=friendfeed onclick='return oShare.Go("Gamer Blog",76171,"Feed","http://www.trueachievements.com/gamerblogcomment.aspx?gamerblogid=76171",&#39;&#39;),!1' title="Share via Feed"><span>Feed </span><i class="tgn-icon ta-emb" title="Share to TrueAchievements friend feed"></i></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tb7UnpicoJmaw6a5xKerrGaTpLpws8CmnKuanKS0pLvMppynrF6WwLHEnqCYpp2il7mws8iddHBuYWx%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leonard-bernstein-jewish-or-christian-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Was Leonard Bernstein Jewish Or Christian?
