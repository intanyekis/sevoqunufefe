Palm oil is central to Nutella, but it’s one of the main causes of deforestation and habitat damage.</p><p>In addition to being vegan, <a href=#>TBH is gluten-free and kosher</a>. It also contains 6g of protein. It also claims to have 50% less sugar than its competitors.</p><p>Although Noah launched the vegan treat last year, but it’s been making headlines again after <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a> released a taste-test article to see if the hype was worth it. The article said that TBH is runnier, not as sweet, and has a stronger hazelnut flavor than Nutella, which is more cocoa-focused.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing to note, however, is that Nutella is more accessible than TBH. <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a> notes that Nutella averages for $3.67/13 ounces in store, while TBH is $11.30/14 ounces, making it triple the price.</p><p>While sales figures aren’t available for TBH, it’s likely to help expand Noah’s net worth, so long as it continues with its popularity.</p><p><a href=#>The actor is worth a reported $4 million</a>, largely thanks to his role as Will Byers on Stranger Things All the child actors reportedly <a href=#>made $20,000 in their first season</a>. But they were&nbsp; making as much as $250,000 per episode in the show’s fourth season, as per <a href=#>Style Caster</a>, giving them $2 million for the full season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noah may have earned even more during <a href=#>the fourth season, which recently released</a>, meaning his net worth is likely higher than $4 million nowadays.</p><p>Aside from acting, Noah has also made a name for himself on social media. He has nearly 30 million followers on TikTok, 26.4 million followers on Instagram, and 4.6 million subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>One of the actor’s recent TikToks stirred controversy after he <a href=#>exposed Doja Cat for sliding into his DMs</a>. The singer was hoping he could put her in contact with his co-star Joseph Quinn, who was brough to play Eddie Munson in Stranger Things’ most recent season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Doja received backlash for trying to get a teen to be her wing man, she called out Noah on social media for leaking their messages, calling in immature. However, it clearly hasn’t stifled Noah’s popular TikTok account.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Teasing A ‘High School Musical’ Return, Vanessa Hudgens Buys $7.3M Home</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a>, <a href=#>Style Caster</a>, <a href=#>Totally Vegan Buzz</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAtb7Ap56eql2ptaq6xqxkrKyRp3qvu8ChZKybmKOusbyMpZiuppOdsrR5x56YpayYrnqvwdOeo6WZXZa5tbHRp5itoaaafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noelle-schnacky-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-363808-html.html><span>←</span><span>Noelle Schnacky Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
