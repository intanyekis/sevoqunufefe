Authorities are now searching for 20-year-old Brandon Jordan, who suffers from autism and was last spotted Wednesday (Jan. 29) leaving his Leimert Park home in Los Angeles, Calif., <a href=# rel=nofollow>ABC News</a> reports. His mother, Melissa Lollis believes the young man was upset before he left. “He just got agitated, didn’t want to talk about it no more, and just stormed out of the house with nothing,” said Lollis. Family and friends have scoured the area in search of Jordan, posting fliers on campus at his West Lost Angeles College and in areas he usually frequented. Jordan is studying music at WLAC and plans to follow in his father’s footsteps. “He wouldn’t go up to nobody. But now, in a desperate need without his wallet and not having his cellphone, he might reach out and asked somebody for money,” said Lollis. Jordan was last seen wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, gray lounge pants and black sandals. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is encouraged to contact police.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iwor7Fmpqeq12WwrW10q2gnGWjpLtuvsSppquslZm5unnMoqqsoZ6ceq270maYp5%2BVobK0eZFpbmlxY2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-warburton-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Patrick Warburton Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
