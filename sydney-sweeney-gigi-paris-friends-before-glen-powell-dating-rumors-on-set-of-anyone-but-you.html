Sometimes, these situations blossom into something lasting and meaningful. Other times it stirs up controversy or ends up being just a fling. In the case of Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, being on the set of Anyone But You stirred romance rumors that turned dramatic.</p><p>The seemingly innocuous onscreen chemistry between the actors veered into something of a scandal as <a href=#>fans wondered if they hooked up</a>. It also did not help matters that Glen Powell's girlfriend, Gigi Paris, broke up with him while the movie was still in production. Additionally, she severed social media ties with Sydney Sweeney. From these actions, it appeared as though Paris had issues with both parties, but what was her relationship with Sweeney like prior to the Anyone But You scandal?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=were-sydney-sweeney-and-gigi-paris-close-before-her-break-up-with-glen-powell>Were Sydney Sweeney And Gigi Paris Close Before Her Break Up With Glen Powell?</h2><p>Leading up to the complete filming of Anyone But You and the drama that ensued over Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell's onscreen chemistry, Gigi Paris appeared to have been the pair's biggest supporter. Back in January 2023, the model was all about good tidings on Sweeney's Instagram page after the Euphoria actress shared screenshots of a Deadline news article announcing the production of the Rom-com.</p><p>Per Seventeen, Gigi Paris was among the well-wishers on Instagram who showed their support for the actress as she shared some celebratory emojis. Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell finished filming for Anyone But You in April, and this was followed by an appearance at CinemaCon. The star actors attended the event to personally debut the trailer for the romance flick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sydney-sweeney-at-the-2019-la-premiere-of-euphoria.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is safe to say that the Top Gun: Maverick actor and Reality actress were heavy on publicity as they openly flirted while promoting their new movie. After Sydney Sweeney revealed that she and Glen Powell wanted to be at the event in person, he chipped in, "We love seeing ourselves on the big screen." The TV actress then playfully replied, "Oh please, Top Gun," in reference to Powell's 2022 action film. This appeared to be an inside joke between them as Powell quipped, "I love when she calls me that." This had fans wondering if there was more to their friendship.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sydney-sweeney-cannes-film-festival.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Here's What Sydney Sweeney Has Been Up To Since Euphoria's Second Season">Here's What Sydney Sweeney Has Been Up To Since Euphoria's Second Season</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sydney Sweeney proves that she can do more than just act in the teen drama that is Euphoria.</p><p>Two days after CinemaCon, Gigi Paris further piqued fans' curiosity when she took to Instagram to share a cryptic post about their breakup.

Many took to TikTok wanting to know <a href=#>if the rumors were true</a>. One person commented, "Is a rom-com even good if there's aren't cheating rumors?' Another penned, "The way this is such PR, and everyone eating it up."

The plans to make the movie were set in motion after Sydney Sweeney's rapport with Glen Powell at the 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards. The Devotion actor presented her the trophy for Best Fight for her Euphoria brawl in season two.</p><p>Speaking about the event, Powell relayed, "I hand her the golden Popcorn." In response to this, Sweeny teased, "I'm like, 'Wow that's the best handover." Glen Powell went on to gush over their chemistry from that moment as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told the publication</a>:</p><p>"We had chemistry right off the bat.
