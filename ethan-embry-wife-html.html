They were parents to his son, Cogeian Sky Embry, from his previous marriage to Amelinda Smith.</p><p>However, things turned sour within seven years, and the couple separated in April 2012. She was the one who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed for divorce</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the divorce papers filed in LA County Superior Court, she cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the split.&nbsp;She evidently lied because they reconciled just a year later. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By 2013, they were back together.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ethan Embry with his wife Sunny Mabrey as seen on his Instagram in 2015.</strong> (Photo: Ethan Embry/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While talking to dating coach Tara Richter on her FoXXXy Forum podcast in November 2013, he said his dating life <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was insane</a>. "My ex wife and I are dating now," he admitted on the episode.</p><p>He also joked, saying he had fun introducing her to people as his ex wife and that he was getting his alimony money back through the dinner dates she paid for.</p><p>Two years later, they got engaged once again. They even used the same ring he gave her the first time around. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mabrey could not get rid of the ring. "It was too painful. I couldn't imagine letting that go. It meant too much," Mabrey told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Us&nbsp;Weekly</a> in February 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She thought there was also a bit of hope attached to the ring.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>By mid-2015, they had remarried. Going by her anniversary posts on Instagram, it looks like they married the second time on the same day they married the first time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Ethan Embry and Sunny Mabrey Fixed Issues</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Despite having divorced each other the first time around, they still were in each other's lives. That was mainly because of his son, Cogeian.</p><p>She remained close to Cogeian. Therefore, it meant they had to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">see each other</a> at his games and other events.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This went on for a while before Embry realized the distance was not working for him. So, he called her and told her how he felt.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>After this, one day, in 2013, she came to his house to pick Cogeian up. She was wearing his old favorite t-shirt and wore it&nbsp;a bit provocatively. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He even once described his wife's move as "manipulative," but it wasn't harmful. However, they both agreed that just getting back together wouldn't work.</p><p>They realized they first needed to solve the issues that pushed them apart before.</p><p>"We grew up," she admitted to US Weekly. "We needed that time, obviously we did."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Further, she said they were a bit "mixed up" and took their time to solve individual issues and determine what was important to them.</p><p>But neither of them could get rid of the love they had for one another and realized it was time they got back together.</p><p>In his interview with Ritcher, he talked about how difficult it was being away from his now-wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>We both realized that the past two and a half years without each other was…far more difficult than anything we experienced when we were together," he confessed to the podcast host.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2kna6vecSmmauxXay2p7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./willie-geist-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me.html><span>←</span><span>Willie Geist: 25 Things You Dont Know About Me!</span></a>
