The director is also the father of Lucia, 11, with his ex-girlfriend<strong> Oksana Grigorieva</strong>, as well as Hannah, 41, twins Edward and Christian, 38, William, 36, Lois, 33, Milo, 30, and Thomas, 22, with his ex-wife, <strong>Robyn Moore</strong>.</p><p>The Patriot star hasn’t been very active in the entertainment industry since his infamous anti-Semitic rant in 2006. When he released Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, Gibson told Variety: “Ten years have gone by. I’m feeling good. I’m sober, all of that kind of stuff, and for me it’s a dim thing in the past. But others bring it up, which [I kind of] find annoying, because I don’t understand why after 10 years it’s any kind of issue.”</p><p>In June 2020, <a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong> </a>addressed the offensive behavior, telling The Sunday Times about <a href=#>anti-Semitic and homophobic comments</a> the Mad Max star made at a party.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I believe in redemption and forgiveness and hope that Mr. Gibson has found a healthy way to deal with his demons, but I am not one of them,” the <a href=#>Stranger Things </a>star, 49, told Us in a statement at the time. “Around 1996, my friend <strong>Kevyn Aucoin</strong> and I were on the receiving end of his hateful words. It is a painful and vivid memory for me. Only by accepting responsibility for our behavior in this life can we make amends and truly respect each other, and I wish him well on this lifelong journey.”</p><p>Gibson’s rep told Us at the time that the actress’ account was “100 percent untrue.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZxitKqu0qilZqukp8Kos8uipaBlpKR6rLHEqWSuqF2strW0jKymp2Wclr%2B0eZNmmKahlGK%2Btq3RmqWtoZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1024053-edge-and-christian-nhl-95.html><span>←</span><span>Edge And Christian Take Us Back To 1995, 5 WWE Superstars With The Most Championship Wins (Videos)</span></a>
