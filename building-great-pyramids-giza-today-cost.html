The entire structure consists of three pyramids named after three pharaohs, or Egyptian kings. It is often compared to other magnificent structures worldwide like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Colosseum, the Stonehenge, and the Parthenon.</p><h2 id=key-features-of-the-great-pyramids-of-giza>Key features of the Great Pyramids of Giza</h2><p>Via: YouTube, TheRichest</p><p>The Great Pyramids of Giza consists of three pyramids, and the largest of them all is the northernmost one called Khufu. All three pyramids are named after famous Pharaohs. The largest one is named after Khufu, who was the second king of the fourth dynasty. Also, the most significant site of attraction is the king's chamber, with mystic inscriptions on granite walls.</p><p>This colossal pyramid is known as the Great Pyramid; the length of each side from the base is approximately 755.75 feet, and the original height is about 481.4 feet. This magnificent pyramid's entrance is about 51 feet in height, making it a jaw-dropping tourist experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Seven Wonders of the World</a></span></p><p>The fourth king of the fourth dynasty was called Khafre, and the middle pyramid is named after him. <a href=#>This pyramid has</a> an original height of about 471 feet, while each side's length is about 707.75 feet.</p><p>The fifth king of the fourth dynasty was Menkaure, and the southernmost pyramid is named after him. This pyramid's sides are about 218 feet, and the original height is approximately 356 feet. There are three smaller pyramid structures adjacent to the Menkaure known as the <a href=#>Queen's Pyramids</a>.</p><p>These were the original dimensions of the grand structures. However, the Great Pyramids of Giza went through a lot of plundering and corrosion. The pyramids' actual heights are reported to have reduced due to the wearing out of the external smooth white limestone layer. The roofs are gabled, and the floors are made with granite stones.</p><h2 id=the-great-pyramids-of-giza-as-a-symbol-of-power-and-wealth>The Great Pyramids of Giza as a Symbol of Power and Wealth</h2><p>Via: YouTube, TheRichest</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Great Pyramids of Giza are the extravagant burial grounds for members of the royal family. There were smaller pyramids on the slides of the three significant structures for other royal bloodline members. However, they got demolished under years of weathering of rocks.</p><p>The Egyptians like to flaunt their power and wealth by following this ancient tradition of erecting pyramids as burial grounds for their pharaohs. <a href=#>The core of the pyramids was made of yellow limestone</a>. The topmost layer was of an elegant white limestone, but that layer is hardly visible due to corrosion.</p><p>The pharaohs of Egypt were owners of great wrath and unlimited resources. Building larger-than-life structures as reverence to the dead ones was also a way to flaunt the fantastic wealth they had amassed over years of royalty.</p><h2 id=current-day-cost-of-building-the-pyramids-of-giza>Current Day Cost of Building the Pyramids of Giza</h2><p>Via: YouTube, TheRichest</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A question that has bothered experts for years is how exactly the Great Pyramids of Giza's brilliant structures were constructed. It is mind-blowing to witness such instances of fantastic engineering and architecture in an age that did not have the advanced tools and weapons.</p><p>Experts have indulged and are still attempting to speculate how much building such a magnificent structure costs today. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimate is&nbsp;</a><a href=#>$1.5 billion</a> given the massive quantity of stone used in building the great pyramids. The limestone blocks alone have an expense of about $495 for each block.</p><p>The cost of the stone is only a part of the entire expense. The construction would employ various kinds of industrial tools to get the work done swiftly. Building a colossal structure like this would require about 12 cranes to function simultaneously for maximum productivity. Cranes would install the stone structure, and these alone <a href=#>would cost about</a> $60 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That is not all. The total amount of human resources necessary would be around 600 members in the labor force, and this workforce would cost <a href=#>$4.2 million</a>. It is speculated that thousands of slaves and farmers erected the great pyramids of Giza. There's a myth that the Pharaohs practically owned them and did not have to pay them for their labor; however, in reality, it was a moment of pride for the farmers who took part in building such a remarkable monument.</p><p>The speculations regarding the building cost of the Great Pyramids of Giza are mind-boggling. It only makes sense when one considers that the Pharaohs had unlimited wealth and resources to afford this level of luxury.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Wealthiest Royal Family: Inside King Salman’s $1.5 Trillion Empire</a></span></p><p>Source - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Richest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN Business</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bigrentz</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmabrZmhsaq6xmaeq52RqXqxxdGapKKco2K0qsbAZquonJGueqS70q1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brent-musburger.html><span>←</span><span>Brent Musburger</span></a>
