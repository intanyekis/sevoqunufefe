<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Who Are Amybeth McNulty Parents? Is The Actress Dating Lucas Jade Zumann Now?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Amybeth McNulty, an Irish-Canadian actress, is well known for starring in the CBC/Netflix drama series Anne with an E from 2017 to 2019. She portrayed her character Anne Shirley Cuthbert in the drama series by Lucy and Montgomery based on the 1908 novel Anne of Green.</p><p>McNulty also played the character of Vickie in Stranger Things. She received the ACTRA Award for Best Performance—Female and the Canadian Screen Award for Best Television Actress for her portrayal of Gwen Inhat in The A.V. Club.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-amybeth-mcnulty-parents></span>Who Are Amybeth McNulty Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amybeth was born on November 7, 2001, to her parents, including her Irish father and Canadian mother, in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland.</p><p>Amybeth recently lost her mother on October 6, 2020, and also posted a rest in peace photograph for her mother on her Instagram handle. The actress is available under the username&nbsp;@amybethmcnulty&nbsp;with an officially verified account.</p><p>McNulty is also of Scottish descent. She attended a home school and received acting and ballet instruction while participating in An Grianán’s “Youth Theatre.”</p><p>Amybeth’s love and support have always been the major source of her motivation to work hard to establish an image of herself in the movie industry. Sadly, the name of her parents has not been disclosed on any public platform.</p><p>McNulty first experienced performing on stage, beginning with ballet and informal performances at An Grianán’s “Youth Theatre,” which was organized by Nora Kavanagh, in addition to musicals by the author and composer Paul Boyd.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-amybeth-mcnulty-dating-lucas-jade-zumann-now></span>Is Amybeth McNulty Dating Lucas Jade Zumann Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amybeth McNulty and Jade Zumann are now on the shooting set of season 3 of The Maritime Edit and do not seem to be dating each other. Rather, the duo seems to be professionally involved in sharing the screen.</p><p>The Maritime Edit is a premium media company showcasing all that Atlantic Canada offers. It is a magazine, broadcasting, and media production company.</p><p>American actor Lucas Jade Zumann, age 21, was born on December 12, 2000 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. His career runs from 2015 to the present, and he is best known for his role as Gilbert Blythe in Anne with an E.</p><p>There have not been any public revelations about Amybeth dating Lucas, so the rumor cannot be confirmed. Likewise, the actors have also not shared any information on their social media handles, where they seem to remain pretty active.</p><p>Therefore, it is only fair to say that the duo are not dating each other and are not romantically involved. Even if they are, the couple has kept the news secret from their fans.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amybeth-mcnulty-boyfriend-louis-hynes></span>Amybeth McNulty-Boyfriend Louis Hynes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amybeth McNulty and her boyfriend, Louis Hynes, have been dating since about mid-2020. In May 2021, the couple marked their first wedding anniversary. However, there is currently speculation that the couple may have split up.</p><p>When she mentioned being alone on her Instagram stories a few days earlier, the breakup rumors increased.</p><p>Louis Hynes was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, on October 9, 2001. He is an actor best known for Barbarians Rising, The Great, and A Series of Unfortunate Events.</p><p>McNulty and Hynes are sending conflicting signals about their relationship, despite their posts claiming to be single. She is the one who sends the initial confusing message. She continues to post tweets and videos with him on her YouTube page and Twitter account.</p><p>Amybeth also made the decision to continue working with them and a few of her pals starting on August 31, 2021. The images are from their first festival following the start of the COVID outbreak. Therefore, there is no official confirmation of their breakup, and hence nothing can be said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=amybeth-mcnultys-net-worth-2022-how-rich-is-the-actress></span>Amybeth McNulty’s Net Worth 2022-How Rich Is The Actress?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amybeth McNulty, an actress popular for her appearances in Anne with an E and Stranger Things, has estimated a net worth of about $1.5 million, which she has accumulated from her career in the movie and entertainment industry.</p><p>In 2015, McNulty played the younger version of the title character in Agatha Raisin and had a special appearance in The Sparticle Mystery on CBBC.

She also starred in the 2020 film Black Medicine, where she plays an Irish teen addicted to booze and drugs.</p><p>McNulty will star in director Michael McGowan’s movie version of Canadian author Miriam Toews’ novel All My Puny Sorrows, which will be released in December 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmmKaxkprBqXnMnKWupKSuerGt0Z6lratdnsBuwMeeZJqbpKeytL%2BMnZitoZ6ceq3BwpqqZqKRmbJuxtSmmKemXaO8uHmRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./travis-scott-defends-bugatti-amid-astroworld-lawsuit.html><span>←</span><span>Travis Scott Defends Buying $5.5M Bugatti Amid $10 Billion Astroworld Lawsuits</span></a>
