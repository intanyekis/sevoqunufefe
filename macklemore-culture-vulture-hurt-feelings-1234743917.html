We were at a different place with whiteness in Hip Hop a decade ago. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It was a very different time</a>.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the scathing critiques poured in, the “Dance Off” entertainer expressed that he found solace in the criticism. Macklemore stated he began to listen to what was being said and dug deeper in himself, understanding that he “can’t control who resonates with [his] art.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-852720708.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I get to tell my story</a>. That’s it. That’s what I’m in control of. I get to make the music that I make. What happens after that is completely out of my control, I am powerless,” he continued. “Once I started to really work on that and do a deep dive — because I had no other choice, right? I was getting scrutinized by the world. I won the Grammys, I apologized to Kendrick, and everyone’s like, ‘You suck. You’re not Hip Hop.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh my God.’ There’s only two ways out of this: stopping or accepting it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Because whatever everyone else was saying about me wasn’t my truth. If I know myself, if I’m coming from a place of faith rather than fear, if I’m coming from radical love versus hatred, if I’m coming from a place of, ‘This is authentically me, take it or leave it,’ it’s not my business what the final decision is. That’s it. I don’t control other people’s perspective. Really it’s like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Four Agreements</a>&nbsp;— it’s not any of my business.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Macklemore concluded his conversation stating that, in creating albums after&nbsp;The Heist, he had to ignore the objections against his art.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The truth is, I’m the best version of me when I let go of all of that, and I actually have the best shot of changing the world if I can let go of that. I cannot be someone that is a servant to a conduit bigger than myself if I am thinking about myself in this place of ego — tunnel vision ego versus the bigger portrait of this universe in my precious time here. That’s what matters.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1470569471.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The rapper recently dropped off his latest studio LP,&nbsp;BEN, on March 3, 2023.&nbsp;BEN&nbsp;features guest appearances from DJ Premier, Jackson Lee Morgan, Morray, NLE Choppa, Sarah Barthel, Vic Daggs II, and more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6KupLfLnqSoqpVisLa4066pnmWmqrm1wdGeZKGtoql6p7HEpaCnn6NifnN%2Fk3BrbHFhbHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alessia-cara-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Alessia Cara Net Worth How Much is Alessia Cara Worth?</span></a>
