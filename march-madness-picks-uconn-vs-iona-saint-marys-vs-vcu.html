While the public is betting Pitino because he’s a good coach, I wonder how focused he is right now.</p><p>There are reports that Pitino to St. John’s is a done deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Have you ever accepted a new job and given your current employer a two-week notice?</p><p>I have, and I can promise 100 percent of my focus wasn’t on my current job.</p><p>It’s human nature for Pitino’s mind to be elsewhere if he already knows he’s leaving.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/pitino-1.jpg><p>On the court, this is a bad matchup for Iona, especially on the boards.</p><p>The Huskies are the top rated offensive rebounding team in college basketball, while Iona ranks 272nd in defensive rebounding percentage.</p><p>And that’s with the Gaels ranking 254th in strength of schedule.</p><p>Iona will have no answers for UConn’s big front line of 6-foot-9 Adama Sanogo, 6-8 Alex Karaban and 7-2 Donovan Clingan.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, UConn got upset last year by New Mexico State in Round 1.</p><p>Now, that doesn’t mean the Huskies can’t be beaten again.</p><p>However, I don’t think the players will be looking past a first-round opponent after being embarrassed last season.&nbsp;</p><p>There are underdogs to back with much better first-round matchups than Iona.</p><p>I’ll lay the points with the Huskies.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betting on College Basketball?</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Saint Mary’s (-4.5) over VCU</h2><p>This is an interesting game because everyone in the world is backing VCU here.</p><p>At the time of this writing, 71 percent of the bets and 70 percent of the money are on the ’dog in this matchup, according to the Action Network app.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m a little surprised that so many people are taking VCU.</p><p>If you just go by metrics, KenPom has Saint Mary’s rated 11 and VCU 58.</p><p>Yet, the spread is 4.5 and most of the money is on the Rams. Something doesn’t add up.&nbsp;</p><p>VCU comes in hot, winners of nine straight.</p><p>It also plays an aggressive, pressing defense that can give its opponents fits.</p><p>However, if Saint Mary’s can limit turnovers and make VCU play a half-court game, it will have the edge.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/sm-e1679004249915.jpg><p>Saint Mary’s did struggle against the press against BYU in a game where it almost blew a 26-point lead.</p><p>I do believe it’s different in college basketball when kids have five days to prepare for a pressure defense.</p><p>And on paper, the Gaels aren’t sloppy with the basketball, ranking sixth in steal percentage.&nbsp;</p><p>Saint Mary’s has a big advantage if it can avoid turnovers and slow this game down, especially when it comes to rebounding and limiting second-chance opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>The Gaels rank second in defensive rebounding percentage and 13th in limiting their opponent’s second-chance scoring opportunities, according to Haslametrics.</p><p>Meanwhile, VCU can be pushed around on the boards, ranking 167th in offensive rebounding and 241st in defensive rebounding percentage.</p><p>This looks like a case of recency bias.</p><p>VCU won its conference tournament and Saint Mary’s got trounced by Gonzaga.</p><p>Overall though, the metrics say the Gaels are the better team and 4.5 points is too low.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmam9foq6zr8dmpJqcnprAtHnPopqkq12qsLC6zWatrGWZpLuiedKaoKesXaKus8XSZq2sZaaYwnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-look-of-love-smitten-nicky-whelan-cosies-up-to-her-hollywood-star-boyfriend-frank-grillo-in-la.html><span>←</span><span>The look of love!
