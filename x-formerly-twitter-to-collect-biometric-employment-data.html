This would be to “recommend potential jobs for you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job”.</p><p>There has been speculation that X may want to offer recruitment services.</p><p>In May, X Corp acquired a tech recruiting service called Laskie, according to reports.

This will additionally help us tie, for those that choose, an account to a real person by processing their government-issued ID. This will also help X fight impersonation attempts and make the platform more secure.”</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter’s Latest Update: Blocking Feature To Be Removed, Elon Musk Says</a></p><p>Mr Musk has also reiterated X’s plans to give users the option to make video and audio calls.
