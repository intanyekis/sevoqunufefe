Nice to see you. ‘Better Now’ is f–king amazing!’” he recalled on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Howard Stern Show</a> in October 2023 of crossing paths with Swift at the awards show years prior. “And I was like, ‘What?’ That’s f–king crazy, you’re a great f–king songwriter! Thank you so very much.’”</p><p>In a clip, Swift is heard praising Malone’s 2018 track “Better Now,” saying “‘Better Now’ is so insane. I’m so jealous of that song, that hook.”</p><p>“There’s so many beautiful artists in the world and for another artist to acknowledge that is a really, really bitching thing. It’s a really special thing,” Malone recalled of the interaction in October 2023. “That was a really cool moment and it was very inspiring.”</p><p>Malone continued to gush over Swift’s evolving success, and even hinted at their future collaboration.</p><p>“It’s f–king so cool. It’s so cool,” he told <strong>Howard Stern</strong>. “I recently got to hang out with her and she is genuinely one of the most kind and considerate and a f–king hell of a songwriter. Holy s–t, amazing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Everything-to-Know-About-Taylor-Swift-and-Post-Malone-s-Connection-862.jpg><h3>Malone Has a Bond With Travis Kelce</h3><p>Malone is pals with Kelce, sharing the hilarious story of when he <a href=#>lost a game of beer pong</a> against the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and quarterback <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>.</p><p>“I had to get a Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce tattoo,” he said of the penalty to Stern in October 2023, joking that the ink is “well hidden,” before confessing, “No, I don’t mean that. They are sweet guys and talented players. It’s on my arm.”</p><p>When the host quipped that it’s “somewhat embarrassing” Kelce lost to the Chiefs duo, he replied, “No, it’s not! They’re athletes! They’re athletes!”</p><p>Malone then publicly requested a redo with Mahomes and Kelce, saying, “I will say this, and I told Taylor to tell him, ‘Those elbows were crazy.’ And you can’t have your elbows crossing over the table. So I’d like a rematch.”</p><p>Malone added that Kelce and Swift’s romance earned his stamp of approval, gushing that the NFL player is the “sweetest dude.”</p><p>“Nowadays you really never know,” he said. “You meet a lot of people in the world. And what’s cool is, like, it’s cool to see people that are successful, much like Taylor and Travis and Patrick, they really give a s–t about human beings. And I think that’s pretty badass.”</p><h3>Malone Follows Swift on TikTok</h3><p>In 2022, eagled-eyed fans of Malone noticed that the rapper had followed Swift on TikTok.

Would be amazing.”</p><p>They’d have to wait two more years to find out.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>Swift Hits the Jumbotron During Malone’s Super Bowl Performance</h3><p>As Malone sang “America the Beautiful” at February’s Super Bowl LVIII in February 2024, the big screen at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium caught Swift and pal <strong>Blake Lively</strong> swaying along to the rendition.</p><p>Swift and Lively were as surprised as anybody to see themselves, laughing as they were spotted embracing during Malone’s performance.</p><h3>Swift and Malone Play Love Interests in Her ‘Fortnight’ Music Video</h3><p>In addition to collaborating on a song for Swift’s Tortured Poets Department album, Malone played the love interest in the “Fortnight” music video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmerpmotrW1zaBkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZa7pXnPqKqtZZ2WubC6xKxkoaGjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joyelle-nicole-johnson.html><span>←</span><span>Joyelle Nicole Johnson</span></a>
