I was like, ‘Damn,'” he recalled. “We grew up on Nas, man. ‘What did Nas diss us for? Damn this is crazy.’ So when he dissed me for no reason, I’m like, ‘Damn, I didn’t do nothing to Nas.’ But it was when I just signed to Roc-A-Fella and I was like, ‘Damn, man. Do we ignore Nas or do we respond to Nas?'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-665502358.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, stating that he and his crewmates had no choice but to defend their honor given the vulnerable circumstance they were in regarding their lack of sustained success at that time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We had to do that, ’cause I’m like, ‘Damn, we just getting in the door after a f**ked up deal I had at Sony, our backs were against the wall.’ I would never diss Nas for no reason,” he continued. “That’s why I did it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cam’ron and Nas would also settle their differences, <a href=#>brokering peace with one another</a> back in 2014.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Cam’ron’s Instagram Live below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cam’ron speaking on how he had beef in the past with Artist like Nas & 50 Cent saying he doesn’t get rappers today beef if they’re rich <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/YIxpCvEjpZ</a></p>— AuxGod (@AuxGod_) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 21, 2024</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurr7Op2SbnZWbwG6Bj2aanqakYruiv4yrmKllp5a%2FtHmQa2ptcGdngHeAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-time-bts-proved-they-are-the-most-versatile-boy-band-ever.html><span>←</span><span>BTS May Just Be The Most Versatile Boy Band Ever, Here's Why</span></a>
