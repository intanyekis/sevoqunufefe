I am stunned,” Lemon wrote. “After 17 years at CNN, I would have thought that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network. It is clear that there are some<a href=#> larger issues</a> at play.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Not long after, CNN issued a statement accusing Lemon of misrepresenting what took place.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Don Lemon’s statement about this morning’s events is inaccurate,” CNN Communications tweeted. “He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter.” The exit came just a few months after Lemon stepped down from <a href=#>CNN This Morning</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He first received backlash in February 2023 after stating Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley&nbsp;was “past her prime.” Lemon apologized by <a rel=nofollow href=#>tweeting</a>, “The reference I made to a woman’s ‘prime’ this morning was inartful and irrelevant, as colleagues and loved ones have pointed out, and I regret it. A woman’s age doesn’t define her either personally or professionally. I have countless women in my life who prove that every day.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He was back on air in under one week and agreed to undergo “<a href=#>formal training</a>.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Two months later, he got into a <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234789595>confrontation</a> with Republican presidential candidate&nbsp;Vivek Ramaswamy, which allegedly left “several CNN leaders exasperated” and then, Lemon was let go.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In July of last year, he <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234846333>broke his silence</a> on the matter. “I have a responsibility not only as a journalist, but as an American, to tell the truth,” Lemon said. “I’m not a perfect person. No one is. In order to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, we have to stand up for what is right. We have to stand up for the truth.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He is set to host his own newscast, <a href=#>The Don Lemon Show</a>, on Twitter/X.
