It does not happen often, but every now and again, a secondary character can come along and do some amazing things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Full House</a> was filled with some <a href=#>amazing characters</a>, and one secondary character left a permanent mark on the show's fans. After her time on the show, however, the actress playing the character completely disappeared.</p><p>Let's take a look at the character and the actress who played her.</p><h2 id=gail-edwards-was-featured-on-39-full-house-39>Gail Edwards Was Featured On 'Full House'</h2><p>During the 1990s, Full House was one of the best shows on television, and it featured a great primary cast, as well as some amazing secondary characters. One such character was Vicky, who was played brilliantly by Gail Edwards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to getting the gig on Full House, Edwards had spent years in entertainment landing roles in various projects. She had been in projects like Taxi, Happy Days, MASH, Knight Rider, Benson, Night Court, and The Family Man. It was a steady stream of work, but landing both Blossom and Full House in 1991 was huge for the actress.</p><p>Vicky became a wildly popular character, and many people wanted her to wind up with Danny in the long run. Instead, things would not work between the two of them, which broke fans' hearts. They had a good thing, but the writers ultimately felt that they were not meant to be.</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> wrote, "Their tragic breakup during Full House's seventh season was the first time I felt television-induced pain."</p><p>Even though Edwards had success in acting and was doing quite well for herself on both Full House and Blossom, she would eventually depart the entertainment industry during the '90s, which took people by surprise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Pics Showing How Much These Stars Changed From Full House To Fuller House</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=things-changed-after-39-full-house-39-for-gail-edwards-and-her-career>Things Changed After 'Full House' For Gail Edwards And Her Career</h2><p>It's not often that someone walks away from acting while having success in their career, but this is precisely what Gail Edwards did years back. In 1994, after appearing on Full House and Blossom, Gail called it a career, and instead of this being a short-lived exit, she stayed away for well over a decade.</p><p>Overall, not a whole lot is known about what she was up to during her years away from show business. Gail has been pretty much off the radar for years, popping up every once in a while for charitable events. Even then, these appearances weren't exactly grabbing headlines by major media outlets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that Gail has been a bit more public with is her love of the ukulele, and she has taken to YouTube to post a video of her playing. Again, it's not much, but it's one of the rare things that she has made public.</p><p>Gail Edwards might have walked away from acting back in the '90s, but she would make an unexpected return in a familiar role a few years ago.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Full House' Star John Stamos Shares Adorable Throwback With Elizabeth Olsen</a></span></p><h2 id=gail-edwards-finally-made-a-return-on-39-fuller-house-39>Gail Edwards Finally Made A Return On 'Fuller House'</h2><p>After a massive hiatus from acting, Gail Edwards surprised fans everywhere when she reemerged on Fuller House as Vicky. At long last, the actress was back in the saddle, and this gave fans hope that Vicky and Danny were going to get back together. They were, after all, a fantastic couple on Full House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a> noted, "The sparks certainly flew when she reunited with Danny, but there has been no mention of the couple being together again in the subsequent season. She had come to celebrate Danny, Joey, and Jesse when DJ, Kimmy, and Stephanie threw them a '30th Dadiversary Party.'"</p><p>Sadly, Danny and Vicky only remained friends, something that many people weren't too fond of. It seems so obvious that they belong together, but alas, the writers always find a way to keep them apart. These characters seemingly deserve one another, and maybe they'll end up together if there is a Fullest House.</p><p>Nevertheless, seeing Gail Edwards on the small screen after such a massive break was super cool for fans. According to her IMDb, the actress has nothing on tap as of now. It could be that the offer to come back for Fuller House was simply too good to ignore and was not necessarily her coming back for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What John Stamos Has Been Up To Since His Time On "Full House"</a></span></p><p>Gail Edwards did have quite a solid career in Hollywood, but she ultimately walked away from it all, choosing to live a different life away from the cameras.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans React To Selena Gomez And Sister Re-enacting ‘Full House’ Scene On TikTok</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiemqGcYrKlw8Crm6xllqq5rXnHqKysnV2YvK68y56rnqSpYrynsoytn55lnZa9bsPHnqmeZZGnsm7Ax56wZqafrHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ramon-hilario.html><span>←</span><span>Ramon Hilario</span></a>
