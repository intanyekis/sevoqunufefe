The lavish property has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, as well as a private elevator and entrance. Zendaya, whose net worth is already $15 million, has been supplementing her income by renting out the Brooklyn property for $16,000 per month.</p><p>Zendaya’s current residence is nothing less than spectacular, as she has chosen a $4 million secluded house in Los Angeles that is spread across four acres and has 5000 square feet of living space. The mansion was built in 1939 and will cost far more than the initial price.</p><p>Aside from these, Zendaya owns a Lexus Gs worth $50,000, a Cadillac Escalade, a Lexus RC, a Mercedes E Class, and a Range Rover Vogue, all of which are expensive. The total cost of her vehicles is estimated to be around $350,000.</p><h2>Zendaya’s Earnings</h2><p>Zendaya, the sensational actress, earns approximately $220,000 per month, which amounts to $2.5 million per year. The calculation is a rough estimate of Zendaya’s pre-tax income.</p><p>Zendaya was said to have demanded a higher salary during the filming of Euphoria, making her the highest-paid cast member, with a fee of $50,000 per episode.</p><p>She was paid $30,000 for Dune Part 1 and is expected to raise her demand before Dune 2.

She then appeared in the Disney Channel film “Zapped” (2014), guest-starred on ABC’s “Black-ish” (2015), and starred as K.C. Cooper on “K.C.
