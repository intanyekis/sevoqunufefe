The first photo put Lovato’s assets on display while wearing a bodysuit and <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a>. The second gave fans a closer view of her chest.</p><p>“This is no push-up bra or boob-job y’all!!!

And I just realized that, like, maybe my symptoms weren’t as obvious as before, but it was definitely an eating issue.”</p><p>During a <a href=#>Sonny With a Chance</a> virtual reunion in April, Lovato, who was 19 when the show ended, revealed that the reason her <a href=#>dressing room was 98 degrees was because of her eating disorder</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was underweight and freezing,” she candidly said during the Zoom chat.</p><p>In July 2018, the singer was found unconscious after an accidental drug overdose, which resulted in a two-week hospital stay and <a href=#>checking herself into a rehab center</a>. A year later, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that “every day is a constant struggle” for the singer, who <a href=#>briefly checked back into treatment</a> in March 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGadnZ2eeq271ZqrqGWTmrmmrtGaq56rXZe2qLPEq2Sbp5%2BXwG6txa2cq2WcmsG1tc2gZJ6ZpJ67qHnIrKqunaNitLB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angela-blac-chyna-white-ethika-deal-1234775398.html><span>←</span><span>Angela Blac Chyna White Lands Ethika Deal After Transforming Her Look</span></a>
