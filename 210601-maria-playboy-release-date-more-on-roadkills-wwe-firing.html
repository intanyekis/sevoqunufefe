Johnny Ace was his biggest backer as he put him over huge to Vince McMahon, saying he could be like the new One Man Gang, and that he had good mic skills. McMahon saw pictures of Roadkill and thought he looked impressive. He them came up with an idea for him to completely change his look and be a 1970s-style Polish-American heel from Milwaukee. Then one day, McMahon finally met Roadkill in person after being told so much about him, and he came away less than impressed after discovering that Roadkill is actually only 5’9″. He’s billed as 6’3″. WWE kept Roadkill around a little while longer, but he soon disappeared from OVW, and the axe fell on him on Monday.</p><p>The latest issue of Playboy was sent to subscribers this week and there is a preview photo of a clothed Maria wearing lingerie & a feather boa in the back of the magazine plugging the next issue. The preview for next month’s issue reads: <b>“Maria Kanellis- The WWE’s Sexiest Star has moved from innocent reporter to mistress of the mat. Now her pesky tights are peeled off in a slamming pictorial.”</b> The magazine will be officially released on Friday, March 7, but subscribers will likely get it a bit earlier.</p><p>Lacey Von Erich, daughter of the late Kerry Von Erich who was briefly under a developmental WWE contract last year, will be making an appearance for the WSU women’s wrestling promotion on Saturday, March 8 at the ECPW Arena in Lake Hiawatha, New Jersey. She will do an interview segment with Missy Hyatt. Other girls appearing on the show include Dawn Marie (making her first wrestling appearance in nearly two years), TNA Knockout Champion Awesome Kong, and Angelina Love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpBpbWlpXaKus7XAZqelmamXvLp50Z6jnpmjmnqlrdOeZKanopp6sLqMq6aanJueua2%2FjLCunmWWnr%2BqusY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katy-perry-calls-ariana-grande-the-best-singer-of-our-generation.html><span>←</span><span>Katy Perry Calls Ariana Grande the 'Best Singer of Our Generation'</span></a>
