We can now charge our phones wirelessly, play video games without having to untangle the controllers first, and pop earphones in our ears without threading the wires through our shirts and into our pockets.</p><p>That last one has enjoyed something of a boom in recent years. Turns out the thing about wires that annoyed people most was them becoming inexplicably tangled beyond recognition in our pockets. Apple capitalized on that want for change by releasing what quickly became the very popular AirPods in 2016. $160 and a pair of Apple's wireless earbuds are all yours.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>'London Rental Opportunity Of The Week' Showcases The Capital's Crazy Rent Rates</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That is a lot of money for a pair of earphones, but unsurprising since it's an Apple product. Around five times the price of the company's regular wired earphones. If you want the tech and to lose the headache that comes with tangled wires, you have to pay the price. Trouble is, AirPods are very small which makes them easy to lose. Swedish company Tapper has come up with a novel solution for that problem reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>The AirPods Carrying Strap. A&nbsp; strap AirPod users can wear that is fitted with magnets to attach the earbuds to when not in use. There's one big problem with the carrying strap, and it has not gone unnoticed by people mocking it on social media. It is effectively like reattaching wires to the AirPods, rendering all that money you spent for them to be wireless completely pointless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even worse, the strap will set you back $60. So by the time someone has paid for a pair of AirPods and a strap to carry them with, they may as well have bought seven pairs of regular wired Apple earbuds. Some have come to the defense of the carrying strap, saying that if it charged the AirPods then it would be the perfect product. The trouble is, it doesn't, and since it doesn't, buying it is a round-about way of throwing a lot of money down the drain.</p><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>30 Years On, The Simpsons Might Finally Be Coming To An End</a></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoJmUnLK1v4yapZ1lpJqwqXvAoqmpp5SoeqSt0auwoqaXYsC1vsCpZKudkaF8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hanks-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hanks Made Bank For Forrest Gump, And His Net Worth Soared</span></a>
