<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Riccardo Tisci, Fashion Designer, Body, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>“People’s wardrobe in history is something that society and culture imposed. But sexuality is not about the way you dress”</span>– <span>Riccardo Tisci.</span> This Italian fashion designer has an elegance that is very modern, contemporary, and romantic at the same time. He loves the black color and is an avid fan of dark colors.</p><p>Today we are going to talk about this person who has been bringing a storm in the fashion industry with his work. Not to mention, Tisci is responsible for the initiation of a modeling career for several supermodels. Like <span>Ming Xi,</span> who is <span>Victoria’s Secret model,</span> previously worked with Riccardo.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=riccardo-tisci-childhood-and-education></span>Riccardo Tisci Childhood and Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Riccardo was born in Taranto, Apulia, Italy, along with his family. His family lacked material wealth, but they made it up with emotional warmth. Unfortunately, there is no data about his parent’s name and whereabouts. But we do know that this designer was the youngest member of his family with eight sisters.</p><p><span>Sonia Rykiel, Fashion Designer, Dead, Age, Kids, Net Worth, Instagram, Net Worth>></span></p><p>At the age of <span>14</span>, Riccardo loved goth and used to have long black hair and was usually skinny. During his childhood, he was timid and used to have a lot of white makeup to create a goth style. Tisci studied at the <span>Design Istituto d’Arte Applicata</span> in Cantu. Later he graduated from<span> London’s Central Saint Martins Academy</span> in <span>1999.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-riccardo-tisci></span>How Old Is Riccardo Tisci?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tisci was born in the year <span>1974</span> in a beautiful place in Italy. He celebrates his birthday each year on the <span>8th</span> day of <span>August.</span> In <span>2020,</span> he is <span>45 years old</span> and belongs to the sun sign of Leo. As his sign suggests, this designer has a powerful personality.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no information regarding his height, weight, and vital statistics. We will update the data as soon as it is on the media. Also, he has black eyes and the same colored enchanting eyes. Even more, Riccardo is Italian by nationality and comes from a mixed nationality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional-career></span>Professional Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In<span> 2004 September</span>, Riccardo set up his eponymous label and showed his first collection in Milan for the <span>Autumn/Winter 2005-06</span> season. Soon after that, in<span> 2005 February,</span> he handled Givenchy as a creative director. During that time, this fantastic designer replaced<span> Julien Macdonald</span>.</p><p><span>Sonia Rykiel, Fashion Designer, Dead, Age, Kids, Net Worth, Instagram, Net Worth>></span></p><p>In addition to this, the fashion industry was in shock and awe when he cast the first transgender model on the runway. She is well known in the industry as <span>Lea T,</span> who previously worked as Riccardo’s assistant. Apart from this, in<span> 2011 August</span>, Tisci produced the album artwork for <span>Kanye West</span> and<span> Jay-Z’</span>s album “<span>Watch The Throne.”</span></p><p>Likewise, this versatile fashion designer stepped down from Givenchy in<span> February 2017</span>. There is an abundant amount of melancholy, a hint of Gothic, and sometimes some fetish in his work. His work is respected and considered fantastic all over the globe. In addition to this, Riccardo has appeared on the cover of some fashion magazines as well.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-the-wife-of-riccardo-tisci-is-he-gay></span>Who Is The Wife of Riccardo Tisci? Is He Gay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Until now, this legend has not revealed his sexual orientation in the media. Neither there is any news nor any rumor about his preference. As a result, it is very tough to conclude his sexuality. Furthermore, this incredible fashion designer has not been married to anyone. In the fashion industry, his name is not attached to any models or celebrities.</p><p><span>Neil Barrett Family, Fashion Designer, Age, Height, Career, Net Worth>></span></p><p>At a time like this, we can say that this handsome is unmarried and single. Speaking of children, there is no record of him adopting any kids. Maybe this diva is focusing more on his career right now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=riccardo-tisci-net-worth></span>Riccardo Tisci’ Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Without a doubt, this stunning fashion designer makes a lot of money from his profession. His runway shows, brands, and campaigns always help him add extra bucks to his bank account. Sources suggest that his net worth comprises of six numbers digit. But there is no solid confirmation to support the claim. Similarly, there are no details on his income, salary, and other assets.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=social-media-presence></span>Social Media Presence<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Instagram: <span>2.5 million</span> followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqZmLCivsOoZK2ho5i2brLArJ%2Bip55isaa%2FyKClnqpdl7ylxYycmKudlad6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-guarini-wife-children-net-worth-height-age.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Guarini Married, Wife, Children, Net Worth, Salary, Age, Height, Wiki-Bio</span></a>
