You've got to believe in the person and believe you can meet the challenges you face," Affleck explained. "Neither of us are stupid or naïve. It would be nice if you could have 'The Rules,' but you just can't write it down."</p><p>Yet, in an effort to mend fences and become closer, the pair have established ground rules for themselves to follow.</p><h2 id=what-are-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-rsquo-s-marital-rules>What Are Ben Affleck And Jennifer Lopez’s Marital Rules?</h2><p>It has been reported that Lopez and Affleck have five marriage rules they agreed to follow to keep their marriage strong.</p><p>Affleck and Lopez reportedly decided to shake things up this time around, as reported by Life & Style.

If one partner is stationed abroad for work, the other must book a flight to their location to maintain a regular schedule of quality time together.</p><p>“They’re also really going to make an effort to stagger projects. It’ll be hard because Ben and J.Lo are both so busy, but worth it in the end,” the source said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second guideline requires consistent interaction between Affleck and Lopez. The couple decided to use FaceTime every day if at all possible. This will allow them to stay abreast of each other's activities.</p><p>Affleck and Lopez have also committed to regular child-free holidays. The pair enjoys <a href=#>spending time with their children and each other's children</a>, but they also recognize the importance of quality time spent between the two of them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jlo-and-ben-affleck-rules-2.png><p>The A-listers agree on a lot of things, including their arguments. Lopez and Affleck agreed to keep their problems to themselves <a href=#>and away from the media</a>. And they promise to put the past behind them, whatever problems they may have had.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lopez and Affleck both work in the entertainment world, so they understand the need to keep their professional and personal life distinct.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Jennifer Lopez And Ben Affleck Blended Their Families</a></span></p><p>They integrated their personal and professional lives, which was a mistake they made in the past. Finally, they decided to end their engagement due to problems in their relationship.</p><p>"They will travel back and forth as much as they can to make things work," the source adds. "They don't want to hide anymore. They are both excited about their relationship. They want to make sure they do everything they can to make this work. Jennifer is incredibly happy. She feels like she can just be herself around Ben."</p><p>The pair appears to be so content that they got matching tattoos to symbolize their love for one another. Wonderwall claims that Lopez and Affleck departed a Valentine's Day meal at California's Giorgio Baldi restaurant beaming with happiness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jlo-and-ben-affleck-rules.png><p>On the same day, J.Lo shared photographs of her and Ben's matching arrow-themed tattoos on Instagram with the caption "Commitment" and an infinity sign emoji, adding, "Happy Valentine's Day, my love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihpaddlrulecGepWaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBiv7a4xKxkrKCVYrqisMRmn56qXaW%2FpsLIqKysZaOlvLa%2FxKxkn6ecoby4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-pegula.html><span>←</span><span>Billionaire Terry Pegula's daughter, Jessica Pegula a tennis player is dating Taylor Gahagen</span></a>
