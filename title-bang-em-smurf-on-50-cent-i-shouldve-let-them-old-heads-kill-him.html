He had nothin’. He was on his last leg. You know me, me being a good nigga, I am always going to stand up for a nigga who I think is a real nigga in a bad position at the time. I should’ve let the nigga suffer. I should’ve let them old heads kill him.”</p><p>According to Bang ‘Em Smurf, he and the <a href=#>Animal Ambition</a> rapper&nbsp;have a long history that extends to when Smurf was a 13 years old.</p><p>Bang ‘Em Smurf also details the origins of G-Unit, recalling when <a href=#>the&nbsp;Power producer</a>&nbsp;pitched the idea to him&nbsp;after the G-Unit boss&nbsp;suggested that they take a ride together.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Smurf was a known drug dealer at the time and 50 Cent assured him that he wouldn’t have to do that anymore if he joined the <a href=#>G-Unit</a> movement.</p><p>“I was like, ‘No doubt my nigga.
