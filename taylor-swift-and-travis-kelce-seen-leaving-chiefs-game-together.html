While he was on the field, the singer was in his suite, watching the game alongside his mom, <a href=#><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>. Swift seemed enthusiastic, cheering for the Chiefs, chest bumping one of her pals and even appearing to enthusiastically shout “Let’s f–king go” at one point.</p><p>She wore a Chiefs windbreaker over a white tank top and accessorized with red lipstick and matching red nail polish. When Swift left the venue with Kelce, per an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram video</a> from sports reporter <strong>Payton Sun</strong>, the football player wore a matching white and blue jacket and pants, perfectly matching the color scheme of her upcoming<a href=#> 1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a> album. Photos on social media showed them <a href=#>driving off together</a> in a convertible.</p><p>The superstar’s presence at the NFL game wasn’t entirely unexpected. Kelce made it clear that <a href=#>Swift had been invited</a> to cheer him on.</p><p>“I told her, ‘You know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit,’” he said during an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on Thursday, September 21. “So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kelce-Swift.jpg><p>Luckily, Swift saw the Chiefs on their A-game. The team won 41 to 10, and quarterback<a href=#><strong> Patrick Mahomes</strong> </a>said the pressure was on to make sure Kelce looked good with his special guest in the stadium.</p><p>“Do you realize how much pressure there was on you from the Swifties to get Travis Kelce a touchdown with Taylor in the house tonight?” Fox Sports’ <a href=#><strong>Erin Andrews</strong></a> asked Mahomes after the game.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I felt a little bit of pressure,” Mahomes admitted. “So I knew I had to get it to Trav. … I think he wanted to get in the end zone just as much as all the Swifties wanted him to.” (Mahomes also celebrated his 10-month-old son <a href=#>Bronze attending for the first time</a>, but the pop star’s attendance just slightly overshadowed his little one’s first NFL game.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kelce-Swift-sign.jpg><p>Prior to connecting with Swift, Travis dated Kayla Nicole on and off for several years. The 12-time Grammy winner, for her part, has been single since May when Us Weekly confirmed she had <a href=#>ended her brief fling</a> with <strong>Matty Healy</strong>. Swift <a href=#>split from her boyfriend</a> of six years, <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a>, in April.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdlruledOrmK%2Bho2K4prjCnmSsnZWjeq2xwK%2Bgp59dmLWqscWsZKCZnZp6tbvGnquhnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brent-venables-sons-who-are-tyler-and-jake-venables-family-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Brent Venables Sons, Who Are Tyler and Jake Venables?
