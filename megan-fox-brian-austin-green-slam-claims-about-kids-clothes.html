Exploiting<a href=#> my child’s gender identity</a> to gain attention in your political campaign has put you on the wrong side of the universe.”</p><p class=p1>Starbuck — a former music video director, who is currently running for Congress — tweeted photos of Fox out with <a href=#>her kids, Noah, 10, Bodhi, 9, and Journey, 6,</a> earlier this month, claiming they used to live in the same neighborhood.</p><p class=p1>“I saw two of them have a full-on breakdown, saying they were forced by their mom to wear girls’ clothes as their nanny tried to console them,” Starbuck, 34, alleged at the time. “It’s pure child abuse.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Transformers&nbsp;</i>actress and the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a>&nbsp;</i>alum, 49, have each shut down the allegations about forcibly dressing their kids in certain outfits.</p><p class=p1>“It’s a totally bogus story. There are only a few people in their world that can actually verify wether [sic] or not a story like this is true and I can tell you with absolute certainty it is not,” Green — who also shares son <a href=#>Kassius</a>, 21, with ex <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Marcil</strong></a> and son <a href=#>Zane</a>, 11 months, with partner <a href=#><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a> — told <a href=#>TMZ</a> on Saturday. “This person trying to claim this is true is a perfect example of someone with selfish motives that does not care about negatively affecting a parent-child relationship.”</p><p class=p1>Fox, for her part, noted in her Instagram message that she has “been burned at the stake by insecure, narcissistic, impotent little men” like Starbuck many times but is “still here.” She concluded: “You f—ked with the wrong witch.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Jennifer’s Body&nbsp;</i>actress, who is currently engaged to <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a>, has previously been candid about accepting her sons for who they are.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“My kid is so brave, my child is so brave and I know that they’ve chosen this journey for a reason,”&nbsp;Fox <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Glamour UK&nbsp;</i>during her April 2022 cover story</a>, noting Noah <a href=#>has been wearing dresses since he was 2 years old</a>. “It’s just hard as a mom. … I have a lot of worries about [Noah’s gender expression] because I just wish that humanity was not like this.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Holiday in the Sun&nbsp;</i>actress continued: “So from the time they were very young, I’ve incorporated those things into their daily lives so that nobody feels like they are weird or strange or different. I can’t control the way other people react to my children. I can’t control the things that other children&nbsp;—&nbsp;that they go to school with&nbsp;—&nbsp;have been taught and then repeat to them. … I’m so proud of my kids.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZeWu26yzrFkm6qZlrturdSsq6KmXZy%2FprHNZqqlmZ1isK2tyKaqZpmSpMK1ecqim6xlk6G8tbTErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-maloney-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Maloney Net Worth - KahawaTungu</span></a>
