“The parties have experienced irreconcilable differences for a period of at least six months which has caused the breakdown of their marriage and it is apparent that the marriage should be dissolved as there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation,” Scalia stated in the documents."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They <a href=#>welcomed their daughter, Markie</a>, in February 2017.&nbsp; “My Markie Girl 💗,” Lauren captioned an Instagram snap of her and the infant after giving birth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-484525959.jpg><p class=x_elementToProof>Speculation that the pair had called it quits first sparked in 2017 when eagle-eyed fans noticed that Lauren hadn’t shared a social media photo of her husband in more than a year. Scalia later shut down the rumors in a January 2019 Facebook post, writing, “We just don’t put our relationship on social media and people can’t seem to understand that. We are perfect!!!!!!”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Earlier this year, rumors swirled once again when Lauren posted via Instagram while not wearing her wedding ring, Lauren, however, quickly clapped back at people for questioning her relationship status.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>“First of all, I truly give zero f**ks if you admire me or not,” she wrote in the comments section in July. “Secondly, I haven’t been on TV for 7 years.” She continued, “I am allowed to keep many aspects of my life private especially after having a child. If you don’t like it then stay away from my page. Simple as that.”</p><p>Lauren has faced a myriad of changes this year. In May,<a href=#> she revealed that she had lost 80 pounds</a>, crediting weight loss drug Mounjaro for helping her shed the last 30. “I went gluten [and] dairy free over a year ago. I had the Lap-Band, I got it removed again. I got up to 208 pounds,” she told Page Six at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_elementToProof>The former reality star recognized <a href=#>that some “don’t like” or “applaud” the drug,</a> adding, “It’s a shot in your stomach once a week, it’s the same as Ozempic. And honestly, I really do believe that obesity and things like that — they are a major issue with people — it is causing mental health issues for me. You guys have seen the struggle with this since I’m 20 years old, and it’s been really hard for me.”</p><p class=x_elementToProof>Lauren appeared alongside her mom and brothers<a href=#><strong> Albie</strong></a> and <strong>Chris Manzo</strong>&nbsp;for the first five seasons of RHONJ, which premiered in 2009. She and her siblings also starred in the Bravo spinoff Manzo’d With Children, which aired from 2014 to 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2Bjt7R5y5qsq52eYrqiutmoqmagpaivorrDZq2irJ9iwKSty6KYZp6ZobK0ecWoqWacmau8s6%2FEZqmeqJ%2BnwbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-nash-sun-sports-rays-reporter-takes-amazing-self-portrait-boston-saved-baseball.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Nash, Sun Sports Rays Reporter, Takes Amazing Self-Portrait in Boston.
