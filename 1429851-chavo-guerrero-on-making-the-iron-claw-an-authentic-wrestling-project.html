Anytime I get an actor in the ring, it’s different. It’s like having a student. You can’t just teach one way to all of your students. A good teacher always adapts their teaching to their student. So these aren’t my students. I’m training them to look like wrestlers in wrestling scenes. These are actors, these are grown men that A24 and Sean Durkin are trusting me to train them and be safe.</p><p>“So it’s a different dynamic than actually training a pro wrestler. But these guys, I have these actors that they’re at the top of their game for a reason. They’re overachievers, they come ready and prepared. It’s not like I have to get them motivated and say, ‘Come on guys, let’s get in the ring. Let’s stop talking.’ No, these guys are ready to work. They’re here for a reason. And that really made my job a lot easier,” Chavo Guerrero said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-everyone-at-the-iron-claw-set-had-surprised-chavo-guerrero>Everyone at the Iron Claw set had surprised Chavo Guerrero</h2><p>Guerrero also mentioned that he was caught by surprise every day he worked in the film.</p><p>“And every one of them surprised me every single day. Every time we’d get in the ring, they’d be doing something different that I didn’t know that they could do. I’m like, “Wow, okay, that’s great. Let me take that and let me add that into a choreography or something.” Or, “Hey, man, I have an idea. You think can do this?” And they would all work differently about it.</p><p>“So Jeremy Allen White would almost sit in the corner for a second and kind of visualize it and visualize and visualize. And he’d be like, “Okay, I’m ready.” Zac? I would walk through things with Zac, “Okay, let’s do this.” And everybody’s different how they do it, but they all get the job done. And if you see the movie, these guys are amazing and they look like they’re pro wrestlers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNrcHFtYWKwqa3VqGSgrZWnv6a%2Bzmamp2WdlriqusZmq6GdXZ6%2FsLqMnKOar12Wu26t1K2fnqaknrBuw9Geqq2kmaO0brzRqKGem6Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./azja-pryor-bio-wiki-age-height-weight-family-husband-networth.html><span>←</span><span>Azja Pryor Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Husband, Networth</span></a>
