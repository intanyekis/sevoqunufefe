Tina shared his son had only begun working at his "new job and had found love."</p><p class=dh>Craig had told his mother about his new partner and how strongly he felt about her. He even planned to introduce them and was "happy" about his new job. Tina <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.people.com/music/tina-turner-says-loneliness-was-a-big-factor-in-her-son-craigs-suicide/>reiterated</a> her statement about what could possibly have led to the demise of her son:</p><p class=dh>"I have no idea what pulled him down, except something that followed him with loneliness. [..] But [..]why didn't he call the new girlfriend that gave him the lift?"</p><p class=dh>The retired singer described Craig, who she welcomed in her teens with saxophonist Raymond Hill, as reserved and "very shy."</p><p class=dh>Craig once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tina-turner-hbo-documentary-fails-absence-mother-source>revealed</a> that his mother was "strict," especially when she was "home" with them. They had to partake in domestic "chores," and she ensured they ate meals together.

She divorced Ike Sr. in 1978.</p><p class=dh>Tina admitted that she did not "spend a lot of time" with her kids and that separation made her suffer. She acknowledged that they "needed more" of her attention.</p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Tina</a> is married to her second husband, actor, and producer Erwin Bach, whom she wed in 2013. The couple has since relocated to Europe, leading Tina to leave all her sons behind.</p><p class=dh>In August 2018, one of her adopted sons, Ike Jr., disclosed that she had abandoned the family in the United States for her life in Europe. The music superstar brought him up from the age of two. That said, "She's the only mother I've ever known," <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5669995/Tina-turned-family-claims-adopted-son-Ike-Junior.html>said</a> the musician.</p><p class=dh>He added the last time they were in contact was perhaps in the year 2000 and that it was less likely that his brothers had also managed to stay in touch with her.</p><p class=dh>On December 9, 2022, Tina <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl9Y5HtDRav/>revealed</a> on Instagram that her youngest son, Ronnie, had died. The actress posted a black and white picture of herself with her eyes closed and captioned it:</p><p class=dh>"Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow, I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son."</p><p class=dh>Police reportedly received a 911 call from someone who said Ronnie was outside their house and had trouble breathing. Shortly after, he stopped breathing altogether.</p><p class=dh>Paramedics arrived at the scene and found bystanders attempting CPR on the actor; unfortunately, they could not resuscitate him.</p><p class=dh>Ronnie sadly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tmz.com/2022/12/09/tina-turner-ike-turner-son-ronnie-turner-dead-dies-62/>died at the scene</a>, and information regarding the cause of his death is yet to be revealed. He previously experienced several health issues, including cancer.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Ronnie Is Survived by His Wife & Two Kids</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Tina's life was documented in HBO's Max's documentary, "Tina," released in March 2021, and Ronnie did not feature in it.

The source divulged he and his wife, Afida Turner, thought the biography was "well done."</p><p class=dh>Although they gave "credit" to his dad as a "successful" performer, the couple felt saddened that Ronnie was not a part of the documentary featuring his parents.</p><p class=dh>The said source speculated that the reason why Ronnie did not appear in the film was "because it was produced by Erwin."</p><p class=dh>On December 8, 2022, Afida paid tribute to her now-late beloved husband on Instagram, sharing a snapshot of him holding a microphone.</p><p class=dh>"My God, Ronnie Turner, a true angel, huge soul, highly spiritual.

The French musician recently shared a snap alongside Ronnie and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCK1SypRht/>expressed</a> shock and deep "sadness" at his death.</p><p class=dh>Afida, who shares two children with Ronnie, shared a picture of him and his famous mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCOYUbp-q3/>performing on stage</a> and chose not to caption the image. Instead, she only shared a string of emojis, including angry faces and crying emojis.</p><p class=dh>The media personality also posted another throwback picture of Ronnie and his older brother, Craig, and stated the siblings are now <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCTSUNpU3l/>reunited in death</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Tina Is a Grandmother of Two</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The "What Up?" star and the California native had two children together, making <a class="me a" href=#>Tina</a> a grandmother of <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/tina-turner-grandchildren>two grandkids</a>.
