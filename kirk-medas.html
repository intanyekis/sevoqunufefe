For a series that follows the party lives of seven other cast members who live a beach house on the Gulf Coast at Panama City Beach, Medas nails it on the character form.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is known to value family over everything else and often gets into fights because of it. Did you know that the reality star has a criminal record?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here’s the inside scoop on that and our take on his net worth, age, girlfriend, and Wiki-bio</span></p><h2><span id=Who-is-Kirk-Medas><b>Who is Kirk Medas?</b></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kirk rose to fame in 2017’s edition of </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span style=font-weight:400>MTV’s Floribama Shore</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. The series has the same theme as 2010’s </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span style=font-weight:400>Jersey Shore</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and feels like a reboot but with different characters in a different location.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They include Kirk’s closest pal, Gus, Aimee, Candace, Codi, Jeremiah, Kirk, Kortni and Nilsa.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2521 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realitystarfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/42384267_339995513211956_121406247704649022_n.jpg alt="Image of Kirk Medas from Floribama Shore show" width=600 height=503 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before his involvement in television, the reality star had always had a thing for sports. He even majored in sports law at the Kennesaw State University in Georgia and is currently a die-hard fan of the University of Miami’s team.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, he never really got to utilize the credentials and initially worked as a social media manager for Shouty LLC. It’s a live-streaming and content creating company according to their LinkedIn page.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It wasn’t long before he wanted a piece of the action and auditioned for a role on television.</span></p><h2><span id=Kirk-Medas8217-net-worth><b>Kirk Medas’ net worth.</b></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>If it wasn’t clear by now, the reality star makes a lot from his acting career which is primarily his primary source of income. However, Kirk Medas’ net worth is $30,000 whereas his salary per episode remains unknown. He hasn’t parted with that information yet.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2522 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realitystarfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kirk-Medas-net-worth.jpg alt="Image of Floribama Shore cast Kirk Medas net worth is $30,000" width=600 height=622 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span style=font-weight:400>Nevertheless, based on his lifestyle and that of his newly found family, the cast of Floribama Shore seem to be in the right place financially. You can always find them in some of the most prestigious clubs in Panama City Beach in their VIP lounges.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When the reality star isn’t squandering his cash on screen, he is always making some off-screen on the already mentioned job at Shouty LLC. It’s all about balancing both careers which he has done quite well so far.</span></p><h2><span id=Is-Kirk-Medas-Married-to-a-wife-or-Dating-a-Girlfriend><b>Is Kirk Medas Married to a wife or Dating a Girlfriend?</b></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>This question has always left many fans on edge. The reality show never digresses on this part of Kirk’s life, and neither does he talk about it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, the answers lie on his social media handles. The reality star is quite vocal and even has a podcast coming up soon, but the one place you can get to know him better is through his Instagram.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2523 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realitystarfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kirk-Medas-single.jpg alt="Image of Kirk medas is currently dating with his girlfriend" width=600 height=659 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span style=font-weight:400>There are several uploads of his</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span style=font-weight:400> girlfriend</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> which is quite apparent based on the captions. Sure, there are also tons of other girls as well, but it always comes down to that one special girl whom he shared Valentines with.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, he isn’t enthusiastic in letting the world know her and keeps his relationship low-key. The couple doesn’t have kids so far.</span></p><h2><span id=Kirk-Medas-got-Arrested><b>Kirk Medas got Arrested?</b></span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>It turns out; his wild side doesn’t only come out when the cameras are rolling. According to reports by </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span style=font-weight:400>Radar Online</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, the reality star was once arrested back in 2010 for battery and underage drinking.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Files from the local authority state that he got caught with a 12 ounce can of Natural light, arrested and held without bond. He was later charged and sentenced to 8 hours of community service and a fine of $200.</span></p><h3><span id=Kirk-Medas-Age-Family-Siblings-Wiki-bio-Facts><b>Kirk Medas Age, Family, Siblings, Wiki-bio, Facts</b></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Full name</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Kirk Medas</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Age</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>31 years old</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Date of Birth</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>January 19</span><span style=font-weight:400>th</span><span style=font-weight:400>, 1992</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Place of Birth</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Atlanta, Georgia</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Profession</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Reality TV star</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Net worth</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$30,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Relationship status</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Dating</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Kids</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>None</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Height</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>5 feet 8 inches</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Weight</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Undisclosed</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Zodiac Sign</span></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>Capricorn</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style=font-weight:400>Medas is a city boy of African American ethnicity who hails from Atlanta, Georgia.
