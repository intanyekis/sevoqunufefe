According to the<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;New York Times</a>, Margolis’ publicist, Henry Eschelman, revealed that the entertainer died in New York City on Thursday (Aug. 3) “after a short illness.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The actor, who has amassed over 100 acting credits throughout his lifetime, has appeared in&nbsp;Scarface,&nbsp;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and&nbsp;Oz, among many other projects dating back to 1976. However, Mark is most notably known for portraying Tio from&nbsp;Breaking Bad.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Margolis received an Emmy nomination for his role as the former cartel enforcer in 2012. The acclaimed actor would reprise his role as a younger version of Tio — before he was in a wheelchair — for the&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;prequel,&nbsp;Better Call Saul.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">His Breaking costar, Bryan Cranston, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>posted a tribute</a> to him on Thursday (Aug. 3). “I am very saddened today to learn of a friend’s passing. Mark Margolis was a really good actor and a lovely human being,” the iconic actor typed. “Fun and engaging off the set, and (in the case of&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;and&nbsp;Your Honor) intimidating and frightening on set.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“His quiet energy belied his mischievous nature and curious mind… And he loved sharing a good joke. I miss him already. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Rest now</a>, Mark and thank you for your friendship and your exceptional body of work,” he concluded.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Magazine</a>,&nbsp;the Philadelphia native spoke about his time playing Tio and why the character fascinated him.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It was a marvelous creature! The fact that he didn’t have any words was not an issue for me,” Margolis said in 2013. “I was delighted not to have to learn any lines. I mean, I had to know what was going on, I had to know my cues, but the fact that I didn’t have to master lines was great. I got to fly out to New Mexico and not worry about memorizing anything.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the interview continued, Mark Margolis opened up about his role as Tio getting him recognized in the street. While he thought nothing of it at first, he noticed that the show and his character were beginning to take on their own lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-503940708.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I can’t get down a street 50 feet without taking a picture or signing an autograph! I was just supposed to be on for one episode,” he said. “After the second season, I didn’t know anyone who knew the show, but after the third season — it just blew up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">VIBE&nbsp;sends our deepest condolences to the Margolis family and all those affected by this loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kus7eMppirn5%2BhtrR5waucmqOZo7RursCdZJudpKmys3nCmqOlZaOWwq15w56YnWVhZ4B1g5ZxanBvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luka-sabbat.html><span>←</span><span>Luka Sabbat Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
